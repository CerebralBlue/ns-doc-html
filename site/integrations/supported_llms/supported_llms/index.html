<td><span id="watsonx.ai - MPT-7B-instruct2">The mpt-7b-instruct2 model can generate longer text than the Flan models. Use caution, however, as the model is prone to both extreme hallucination and runaway responses.  Be sure to set a minimum confidence level to control this. Not reccomended for public usecases. </span></td>

<p>💡 LLM choice is available with NeuralSeek’s BYOLLM (bring your own Large Language Model) plan.</p>
<p>💡 LLMs can vary in their capabilities and performances. Some LLM can take up to 30 seconds and longer to generate a full response. Use caution when using in conjunction with a virtual agent platform that imposes a strict timeout.</p>

<p>⚠️ In order to configure an LLM, make sure that you have subscribed to the Bring Your Own LLM (BYOLLM) plan. All other plans will default to NeuralSeek's curated LLM, and this option will not be available.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>In NeuralSeek UI, navigate to <code>Configure &gt; LLM Details</code> page, using the top menu.</li>
<li>Click <code>Add an LLM</code> button.</li>
<li>Select the Platform and LLM Selection. (e.g. Platform: Self-Hosted, LLM: Flan-u2)</li>
<li>Click <code>Add</code>.</li>
<li>Enter the <code>LLM API key</code> in the LLM API Key input field.</li>
<li>Review the Enabled Languages (presented as multi-select)</li>
<li>Review the LLM functions available (presented as checkbox)</li>
<li>Click <code>Test</code> button to test whether the API key works.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 You must add at least one LLM. If you add multiple, NeuralSeek will load-balance across them for the selected functions that have multiple LLM's. Features that an LLM are not capable of will be unselectable. If you do not provide an LLM for a function, there is no fallback and that function of NeuralSeek will be disabled.</p>
