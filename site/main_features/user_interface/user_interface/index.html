</ul>
<p>User can also perform the following actions through the home page:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Auto-generate questions</strong>: Virtual Agents would typically require an adequate number of questions for creating meaningful intentions and dialogs. This process would typically involve having to manually create them. However, NeuralSeek can generate, based on the contents of your KnowledgeBase, a good set of commonly asked questions for you.</li>
<li><strong>Manually Input questions</strong>: If you already have a good set of questions that your user frequently asks, you can upload them into NeuralSeek and NeuralSeek could categorize and create their answers for you to later review and curate them.</li>
<li><strong>Upload Test questions</strong>: If you want to test out your set of questions, and validate whether their coverage or confidence score is good enough, or find out how their analytics look like, use this. A template CSV file is given for you to use it.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="configure">Configure<a class="headerlink" href="#configure" title="Permanent link"></a></h1>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/configure.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="configure" src="../images/configure.png" /></a></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Why is it important?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>NeuralSeek provides comprehensive guidance on selected integrations which allows for a more user-friendly experience.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Integrate tab on NeuralSeek's user interface provides step-by-step instructions on how to connect to various virtual agent frameworks. Once connected, users are able to call on NeuralSeek through the chosen framework as either a "fallback intent" or other action. <ul>
<li><strong>Custom Extension:</strong> This contains the information to build a custom NeuralSeek extension within Watson Assistant.</li>
<li><strong>LexV2 Lambda:</strong> Use AWS Lambda to send user input that routes the Lex FallbackIntent to NeuralSeek. Used in conjunction with AWS LexV2.</li>
<li><strong>LexV2 Logs:</strong> How to enable Round-Trip Logging using LexV2 Logs, to monitor the usage of curated intents. The purpose of round-trip logging is to improve the virtual agent’s performance by analyzing the data and identifying areas for improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Watson Logs</strong>: How to enable Round-Trip Logging using Watson Logs, to monitor the usage of curated intents. The purpose of round-trip logging is to improve the virtual agent’s performance by analyzing the data and identifying areas for improvement.</li>
<li><strong>WebHook</strong>: This is the backbone of NeuralSeek, how users connect and communicate with the solution. One can make a call to this WebHook from any application (e.g. slack, servicenow, etc.) that can forward its question to it and receive answers from.</li>
<li><strong>API (REST)</strong>: Where to find necessary information regarding how to invoke NeuralSeek’s REST API, and navigate and test it right on its openAPI generated page. You can get examples of JSON message requests and responses, as well as JSON schema of the message payloads.</li>
<li><strong>KoreAI</strong>: Activate Round-Trip monitoring for deployed NeuralSeek Intents.
