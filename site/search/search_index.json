You can use this to simply create a contextually aware \"I don't know note\" - but can also use this to kick off a notification, or escalation or externals service call or ticket... Anything really. Semantic Insights - now on the \"hallucinated terms\" chart you can click on a term to directly allow-list items... Data Loader - Drag & drop files to our new loader, which leverages mAIstro to chunk/load docs. You can use any mAIstro function or integration, make rest calls, generate embeddings, automatically loop and chunk documents... We give an example loader for elastic/watsonx discovery. Governace for mAIstro! Automatically track and provide insights for all mAIstro templates, filterable by template. Flow insights helps track time spent across our parallel engine, helping you optimize flows and understand where they are spending the most of their time. Token insights mirrors the Seek token insights tab, helping show token consumption, cost, and model comparison options for the LLM's used to power your mAIstro flows Seek Governance updates Filter by filter... When using filters in seek, now you can automatically track governance by the applied filter. July - 2024 New features New LLM's Mistral-large on watsonx.ai GPT-4o-mini on OpenAI. Streaming api endpoints for seek and mAIstro for watsonx assistant. These have the required content type in the openAPI spec. Note- at the moment streaming seek is not recommended as you can\u2019t use confidence scoring, nor get any payload fields like url. We\u2019ll be working on this with the Watson team. New embedding models, and the ability to use a custom embedding model with NS intent detection and mAIstro Translation Improvements! NS translation is now up to 80% faster for large translations. NeuralSeek Hosted LLM's. When using a BYO-LLM plan we now provide a globally-hosted base LLM (mistral-7b) and purpose-built translation LLM for use with that plan for no additional charges, just the normal seek charge applies. THis should make it much easier to get started with NS. June - 2024 New features New platforms supported: vLLM / \"generic\" openAI-style inference engines. This allows you to plug-and play with many more on-prem and SaaS inference engines Google Vertex is now supported, and we have added Gemini 1.5 pro and Flash. These models are quite good - Pro is on the same tier as GPT-4o, Claude3 Sonnet, and Mistral-Large mAIstro updates! Built-in charting. With a compatible LLM you can ask for a chart to be generated as part of the output. Formatted output - generate and display HTML and javascript New \"Raw\" view - see the code behind charting and generated HTML PDF output Hover Menus! When on the visual builder, all of the nodes now will let you see and insert any secrets, user & system defined variables or generate a new variable. Makes building so much easier! Native integration to watsonx.governance. In mAistro, see our example template for how to configure this - it's really easy, just 3 steps. For watsonx.governance you just need an IAM API key, and from your \"Production\" deployment space in x.gov, under actions/model information we need your Evaluation datamart ID and Subscription ID. We'll send all of the NeuralSeek measures over to watsonx.governance so you can collect and govern them cross-instance and show a larger governance story. We also provide an open-ended integration in case you want to do something more custom. New mAIstro Integrations: (there are so many native functions and connectors in mAistro now we had to add a search feature!) Jira Trello Github Slack AWS S3 Google/Bing/Yahoo/DuckDuckGo web searches. JSON Tools: We added JSON array filter and JSON Escape to make working with complicated payloads much easier inside mAIstro. Auto-Escaping. Now when using the mAIstro visual editor we will auto-escape any quotes. This should make building in mAIstro much easier for business users. We've found these updates plus the mAIstro auto-builder we released last month bring many usecases down to working \"out of the box\" with no additional modifications required to the autogenerated flows. Governance updates: We've enhanced the Token Insights tab, and added a new chart \"Question Resolution\" to the Overview tab to help track how many questions are hitting your minimum confidence threshold. The Logs tab now flags responses that had PII, HAP activation, and Prompt injection actions. May - 2024 New features Virtual KB's! You can now use mAIstro to define a flow and use it as a virtual knowledgebase. Want to query multiple discovery instances at once? Easy. Elastic and DB2 and merge the results? Easy. Scrape a few webpages live and use those? Easy. See the new template in mAIstro for an example of how to configure this. Semantic Allow-list (Config / Semantic Model Tuning). Specify words or phrases to exclude from semantic penalties. Curate updates. Now answers generated by use of a filter will display the filter used during generation Custom Translations. Upload a training file via the API. mAIstro Features Image processing / multimodal support in mAIstro. You can now grab images from the web, local file, or Google Docs and flow them thru LLM's that support image processing (Claude3, GPT-4, GPT-4o). See the new example template. And yes, you can power Seek based on images if you use this with the virtual KB! Auto-builder for mAIstro (SaaS - only). Have you been overwhelmed or afraid to try mAIstro? Not clear on how to build something? Now the welcome modal (and Load modal) will ask you to just describe your usecase, and then we'll auto-generate you a custom template. Snowflake connector! Now available in mAIstro Governance Features Token Insights! A new module comes to NeuralSeek Governance (BYO-LLM plans only). Get cost insights on your LLM usage, metrics on generation speed, Cost comparisons to LLM's of similar capability. It's very compelling. Governance updates - now you can track cache and edited answer hit percentage from the Semantic Insights tab. New Models Lots of new ones. GPT-4o, Mixtral8x-22, and more. April - 2024 The launch of NeuralSeek Governance. New features Remove Hallucinations - turn this on via the Configure tab under Semantic Scoring. As part of a Seek response, remove any sentence containing a key word (proper noun, entity) that is not contained in your source documentation. Proposals. Our take on versioning / configuration changes. You can now define a configuration as a \"Proposal\" and then call that proposal dynamically from the api or the Seek tab or Home tabs. This helps separate admin configuration from SME's testing proposed changes. It also lets you run multiple configs at once without passing a full override every time. Update a config, and click \"Propose Changes\" In addition, a new feature \"Log Alternate Configs\" - lets you block the curation of answers coming from these propsals, so you can test in isolation in a single instance. Configuration Title and Description - as part of our Governance module and the launch of proposals we'll now as you for a configuration title and description on saving. These flow into the governance side of the house for explainability. Pinecone support - our initial release. more embedding model options are coming shortly. Milvus KB conector. So you can now do vector search into watsonx.data Return full Docs - we are rolling out the ability for you to return a full document instead of a passage. Currently release for Discovery and AppSearch. This way if you have carefully created or pre-snipped your documentation you can ensure the full document comes back. Performance improvements - some big updates on areas such as dynamic webscraping, context window splitting, and more. mAIstro Features Secrets! - define variables on the Configure tab to hide them from normal mAIstro users. On prem users can also define variables at the OS level. Very useful for passing / hiding DB connection info. Context Loop - split a large block of text by tokens and loop over it. Ver useful for translating large documents, or sending big things thru a small LLM. See the Document Translation example in mAIstro Google Drive connector - pull from and write to a google drive Variable Loop - loop over an array of data Governance Features Governance module. Our initial focus with this first release is a holistic view of RAG governance with time-based and Intent/Category filtering. We'll be rolling out many more additional capability in the weeks to come here. At launch we have: Executive overview charts Intent Analytics - what intents are trending, and how are they performing - model / document regression System Performance - monitor your instance and compare to the NS universe Semantic insights - What is the quality of the answers being generated Documentation Insights - What documentation is most used, and how is it performing Configuration Insights - monitor configuration changes and track churn over time New Models LLama 3 - a big step up from llama 2 in terms of its ability to follow directions. In watsonx the context window is small, however so mixtral is still overall better. jais-13b-chat - in watsonx frankfurt, for Arabic usecases granite-7b-lab - This one seems better than the other granite models. Under the covers it's based on llama-2... Mistral-Large - similar and iteratively better than mixtral. not yet available on watsonx. March - 2024 Explore is now renamed mAIstro and has gained a variety of new features. New features Fully-custom RAG now available in NeuralSeek, offering simplicity via Seek and complexity via mAIstro, all out of the box and no-code required. mAIstro Features Curate: Send your own Q&A into the curate, analytics, and log tabs. Categorize: Hook into the NS categorizer to get category and intent. Query Cache: Check for and return curated and edited answers.

It allows users to flag, mask, hide, or delete the detected PII. Why is it important? Users can maintain a secure environment while providing accurate responses to user queries, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations and protecting sensitive information. How does it work? Common and well known PII detection is enabled by default in NeuralSeek. When you enter a PII information, for example, when you enter a credit card number in Seek: In NeuralSeek, the question above will be logged and flagged as containing PII information and warns user about a potential risk. The credit card number is also masked and removed, so that the data is protected from being viewed. The answers to these questions also indicate that they were generated from a question with PII in it, so that you can easily identify them. Defining a specific PII However, this is what NeuralSeek does against common PII patterns, and there may be a specific PII that you would like to hide for your specific business needs. If you want to help NeuralSeek better detect and process PII for that, you can configure it under Configure > Personal Identifiable Information (PII) Handling in the top menu: How it works is based on an example sentence, and does not have to be an exact pattern or rules. For example, setting the example sentence as: My name is Howard Yoo and my blood type is O, and I live in Chicago. For each PII element in that sentence, you can define the PII elements in that sentence delimited by comma as such: Howard Yoo, 0 So, next time, when somebody enters a PII matching the example as such: This is my blood type: A NeuralSeek now detects that and masks the blood type that the user provided from being exposed: Ignoring certain PII You can also make NeuralSeek ignore certain PII by entering \u201cNo PII\u201d to the element. For example, by setting the element as \u201cNo PII\u201d with a given example sentence, NeuralSeek will not filter out the question even though it would contain an PII element: Therefore, when asked about a similar question, notice how dog\u2019s name is now visible as not a PII information: The base reason to use this is that sometimes, NeuralSeek would mistake certain questions to be containing PII, even though the sentence may clearly not contain any such data. In that case, setting what not to consider as PII would be very helpful. Round Trip Logging What is it? Round-trip logging is a process that involves recording and storing all interactions between a user and a Virtual Agent. NeuralSeek supports receiving logs from Virtual Agents in order to monitor curated responses. This includes the user\u2019s question, the Virtual Agent\u2019s response, and any follow-up questions or clarifications. Why is it important? The purpose of round-trip logging is to improve the Virtual Agent\u2019s performance by alerting to content in the Virtual Agent that is likely out of date, because the source documentation has changed. How does it work? The Source Virtual Agent is connected to NeuralSeek via the specific instructions per platform on the Integrate tab. Once connected, NeuralSeek will monitor for intents that are being used live in the Virtual Agent. Once per day NeuralSeek will search the connected KnowledgeBase and recompute the hash for the returned data. That hash will be compared to the hash of the answers stored, and if no match is found, an alert will be generated notifying that the source documentation has changed compared to the last Answer generation completed by the seek endpoint. Semantic Analytics What is it? NeuralSeek generates responses by directly utilizing content from corporate sources. In order to ensure transparency between the sources and answers, NeuralSeek reveals the specific origin of the words and phrases that are generated. Clarity is further achieved by employing semantic match scores. These scores compare the generated response with the ground truth documentation, providing a clear understanding of the alignment between the response and the meaning conveyed in source documents. This ensures accuracy and instills confidence in the reliability of the responses generated by NeuralSeek. Why is it important? By being able to analyze how the answer generated would be originated from the actual facts given by the KnowledgeBase, users can analyze from which sources the responses actually originated from, and how much of the responses are directly coming from the knowledge versus how much of them are from LLM\u2019s generated answer. This ensures accuracy and instills confidence in the reliability of the responses generated by NeuralSeek. For example, NeuralSeek\u2019s Seek will provide rich semantic analytics in terms of how well the response cover for the facts found in the KnowledgeBase (or cached generated answers) by color-coding the area of it in the response, visually linking it to the sources, and providing semantic analysis result to explain the key reasons behind the semantic match score given. How does it work? When NeuralSeek receives a question, it will first try to match for existing intents and answers, it will also try to search the underlying corporate KnowledgeBase and return any relevant passages from a number of sources. NeuralSeek will then either use these answers as-is directly, or use parts of the information to form a response using LLM\u2019s generative AI capability. Configuring Semantic Analytics Configuration option for Semantic analysis is found under Configure > Confidence & Warning Thresholds . The semantic score model is enabled by default, but you can also disable it. You can also enable whether the semantic analysis should be used for confidence, and for reranking the search results from the knowledge base according to how much they semantically match. There are also sections for controlling how the analysis can apply penalties for missing key terms, search terms, or how frequent the sources are jumped (fragmented in the generated answer). \u2753 How re-ranking the search result using semantic analysis can be helpful? Having an option to re-rank the resulting KnowledgeBase search results can ensure the list of search results to appear in the order that corresponds better to the answer provided. That is because sometimes the search results returned from the KnowledgeBase do not align perfectly with the answer, and thus the provided URL of the resulting document can be misleading. Using Semantic Analysis In the \u2018Seek\u2019 tab of NeuralSeek, you can provide a question, and be given an answer from NeuralSeek. When enabling the \u2018Provenance\u2019, this will give you the color-coded portion of the response that were directly originated from those results. Below the answer, you will see some of the key insights related to the answer, such as Semantic Match score (in %) , Semantic Analysis , as well as results coming from KnowledgeBase in terms of KB Confidence , KB Coverage , KB Response Time , and KB Results . Semantic Match % is the overall match \u2018score\u2019 that indicates how much NeuralSeek believes that the responses are well aligned with the underlying ground truth (from KnowledgeBase). The higher the % is, the more accurate and relevant the answer is based on the truth. Semantic Analysis explains why NeuralSeek calculated the matching score given in a way that is easy for users to understand. By reading this summary, users are given a good understanding why the answer was given either a high or low score. Knowledge confidence, coverage, response time, and results are all coming from the KnowledgeBase itself. These percentages indicate the level of confidence and coverage, signifying the extent to which the KnowledgeBase believes the retrieved sources are relevant to the provided question. KnowledgeBase contexts are the \u2018snippets\u2019 of sources from the KnowledgeBase, based on the relevance of what it found within its data. Clicking one of them would reveal the found passage, and the color code matching that of the generated answer would be used to highlight the parts that were used. Lastly, the stump speech that is defined in NeuralSeek\u2019s configuration is shown and color-coded based on how much of it was used in the answer. If you are wondering where the Stump Speech is stored, you can find it in Configure > Company / Organization Preferences section: Setting the Date Penalty or Score Range The resulting KnowledgeBase result does get affected by the configuration that you set for the corporate KnowledgeBase you are using with NeuralSeek. You can find these settings in Configure > Corporate KnowledgeBase Details section: Document score range dictates the range of possible \u2018relevance scores\u2019 that it will return as the result. For example, if the score range is 80%, the results will be of relevance score higher than 20% and equal or lower than 100%. If the score range is 20%, the relevancy score range would then be anything between 80% ~ 100%, respectively. Document Date Penalty, if specified higher than 0%, will start to impose penalty scores to reduce the relevancy based on how old the information is coming from. KnowledgeBase will try to find any time related information in the document and would reduce the score based on how old the time is, relative to current time. When the results say, '4 filtered by date penalty or score range', it means these settings came into play when retrieving relevant information from the KnowledgeBase. Examples of Semantic Analysis High score example Medium score example Low score example Sentiment Analysis What is it? NeuralSeek's sentiment analysis is a feature that allows users to analyze the sentiment or emotional tone of a piece of text. It can determine whether the sentiment expressed in the text is positive, negative, or neutral. NeuralSeek's sentiment analysis is based on advanced natural language processing techniques and can provide valuable insights for businesses and organizations. Why is it important? By being able to detect whether a user is negative or positive about certain questions, you can let the virtual agent use this information to provide more tailored services. For example, for a user who expresses negative sentiment, virtual agents might forward the session to human agents or assign higher priority so that more attention could be provided. How does it work? NeuralSeek will run sentiment analysis on the user\u2019s input text. Sentiment is returned as an integer between zero (0) and nine (9), with zero (0) being the most negative, nine (9) being the most positive, and five (5) being neutral. Sentiment Analysis REST API When using REST API, for example, providing negative comments could trigger a low sentiment analysis score. { \"question\" : \"I don't like NeuralSeek\" , \"context\" : {}, \"user_session\" : { \"metadata\" : { \"user_id\" : \"string\" }, \"system\" : { \"session_id\" : \"string\" } }, Would yield a response with low sentiment score: { \"answer\" : \"String i'm sorry to hear that you don't like NeuralSeek.

On the other hand, if you express a positive sentiment as such: { \"question\" : \"I really love NeuralSeek. It's the best software in the world.\" , \"context\" : {}, \"user_session\" : { \"metadata\" : { \"user_id\" : \"string\" }, \"system\" : { \"session_id\" : \"string\" } }, The response will have a higher sentiment score: { \"answer\" : \"Thank you for sharing your positive feedback about NeuralSeek. I cannot have personal opinions, but I'm glad to hear that you find NeuralSeek to be the best software in the world.\" , \"cachedResult\" : false , \"langCode\" : \"string\" , \"sentiment\" : 9 , \"totalCount\" : 9 , \"KBscore\" : 15 , \"score\" : 15 , \"url\" : \"https://neuralseek.com/faq\" , \"document\" : \"FAQ - NeuralSeek\" , \"kbTime\" : 5385 , \"kbCoverage\" : 8 , \"time\" : 7094 } Table Understanding What is it? Table Extraction, also known as Table understanding , pre-processes your documents to extract and parse table data into a format suitable for conversational queries. Since this preparation process is both costly and time-consuming , this feature is opt-in and will consume 1 seek query for every table preprocessed. Also, it should be noted that Web Crawl Collections are not eligible for table understanding, as the recrawl interval will cause excessive computing usage. Table preparation time takes several minutes per page. Why is it important? Being able to understand data in tabular structure in documents and generating answers is an important capability for NeuralSeek in order to better find the relevant data for answering.

Once you have everything set, go over to Watson Discovery , and if you don\u2019t already, create a project and import a pdf file that contains some tables. Once you have the project copy the API information and go back to the Configure in NeuralSeek. Scroll down to Table Understanding, paste the project id, hit save, and proceed to the Seek tab. With everything set, ask some questions related to the data inside the table in the PDF file. What were the GHG emissions for business travel in 2021? You can also ask questions about a specific place or name and if there are multiple tables with data, NeuralSeek will take from each table and provide you with everything. Multimodal LLMs in mAIstro What is it? Multimodal capabilities in large language models (LLMs) refer to their ability to process and generate content across multiple modalities, such as text, images, and even audio. This allows LLMs to understand and interact with the world in a more holistic and natural way, going beyond the traditional text-based interactions. Why is it important? Multimodal capabilities are crucial for a wide range of applications, particularly in areas like visual question answering, image captioning, and image-to-text generation. These capabilities enable LLMs to understand and reason about the world in a more comprehensive manner, allowing for more intuitive and user-friendly interactions. How does it work? Multimodal LLMs typically leverage techniques like transfer learning, where the model is first trained on a large corpus of text data, and then fine-tuned on datasets that combine text and images. This allows the model to learn the relationships between visual and textual information, enabling it to generate relevant and coherent responses to queries that involve both modalities. Steps to Configure the LLM To begin, navigate to the Configure tab and locate the LLM Details section. Click on \"Add an LLM\" and choose a model that can process images, such as OpenAI GPT-4o. Once selected, add the model and enter the necessary connection details, which, for GPT-4o, would be the API Key. Test the connection by clicking the Test button and ensure the button turns green, indicating a successful connection. Save the configuration and provide a meaningful name for the version. Steps to Process an Image Next, switch to the Maistro tab to upload an image. Use the left side pane to search for \"Upload data\" and then select \"Upload file\" under that section. After selecting the local file, a local document node will be created. Set the body of this node like this: << name: img, prompt: true, desc: Enter image file name >> If you plan to use this image for different purposes, it\u2019s best to set it as a variable. Add a set variable node to the right of the local document node and give the variable a descriptive name. Below these nodes, add a send to LLM node. For the prompt, you can use: What is this a picture of? For the image, reference the variable you defined earlier: << name: img, prompt:false >> And the node should be end up like this: Select an LLM that supports reading images, such as GPT-4o. Press the Evaluate button. You will be prompted to enter the name of the image file you want to process, including its file extension. Once entered, the setup will allow Maistro to describe the image. Note This is a basic example, but you can expand on this logic to achieve more complex procedures.","title":"Advanced Features"},{"location":"main_features/advanced_features/advanced_features/#pii-detection","text":"What is it?

Press the Evaluate button. You will be prompted to enter the name of the image file you want to process, including its file extension. Once entered, the setup will allow Maistro to describe the image. Note This is a basic example, but you can expand on this logic to achieve more complex procedures.","title":"Steps to Process an Image"},{"location":"main_features/conversational_capabilities/conversational_capabilities/","text":"Conversational Context What is it? NeuralSeek maintains context during each user interaction (conversation). When initiating a conversation, a session token is generated. Using this token and several Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, NeuralSeek tracks the topic of conversation to keep interactions focused and structured, allowing it to follow-up on questions that do not directly refer to the topic. In addition, these NLP models enable NeuralSeek to filter corporate knowledge topically by date to ensure that the information being returned is focused on the time period of the question. Why is it important? Conversational Context allows for NeuralSeek to answer questions without users being specific about their language for every turn of the conversation. This enables higher containment rates in customer-facing conversations. How does it work? NeuralSeek employs several NLP models to identify and extract meaning, intent, and main subject from user questions and generated responses. These then inform later turns of the conversation so that the proper context can be brought forward from the KnowledgeBase and used for answer formation. It also weighs heavily on caching and how the data can be cached. For example - The answer to a user question like \"how does it work\" depends heavily on the previous statements from a user. NeuralSeek requires that you pass an ID that can uniquely identify a user's session to enable this conversational context. The can be either or both the user_id and the session_id properties on the seek request. You do not need to maintain consistent id's over time for a specific actual person - the id must just be constant for the session that you wish to maintain context for. Curation of Answers What is it? NeuralSeek is directly trained off of the documentation loaded into the KnowledgeBase. If there are undesired answers from NeuralSeek, the first step is to review the documentation within the KnowledgeBase, and effectively curate the answer which can then be used by NeuralSeek to train itself better the next time it answers. Why is it important? One of the key factors in reducing costs is the utilization of curated answers sourced from a pool of responses, which proves to be more economical. Also, when the collection of answers becomes stagnant, potentially leading to outdated information, this feature will be able to detect it and refresh those with less manual process. How does it work? To tackle this challenge, NeuralSeek provides a solution by automatically monitoring the sources of information. It continuously tracks and compares the generated responses with the source documents to determine if any changes have occurred. By doing so, NeuralSeek ensures that the answers remain up-to-date and relevant. This eliminates the need for manual intervention and the potential for outdated information, allowing users to trust the accuracy and currency of the answers provided. Curating Intents and Answers Let's first visit the UI page for curating intents and answers. Click the Curate tab on the top menu. The UI is composed of the following columns: Intent : Intents are a collection of questions that may be related to the similar intent of the question. It is prefixed by certain types of intents, such as FAQ , followed by the question's subject areas. By default, all the intents do fall under a category Others , but you can also define your own category in NeuralSeek's configuration. Intents also have a number of indicators that help users to understand the status of the intent. For example, it can show whether the intent has any new answers, whether the intent contains any PII (personally identifiable information), or whether the intent's underlying data has been outdated, etc. Q&A : Shows the number of questions (white dialog icon) and answers (blue dialog icon) that this particular intent contains. Coverage % : Indicates how much the KnowledgeBase has contributed to the answer's coverage. If NeuralSeek was able to find all the necessary information from the KnowledgeBase, this percentage is going to be very high. Confidence % : Indicates how much NeuralSeek's answer is most likely to satisfy the user. If this score is high, it means the answer has a high score of being legitimate and true to the facts. Reading the trend The data is presented through two distinct graphs: Coverage and Confidence. Coverage Graph : This graph illustrates the total number of citations or reference materials utilized to address a specific question. A coverage value of zero indicates the absence of relevant documentation, while a value of 100% signifies comprehensive documentation available on the topic. Confidence Graph : This graph assesses NeuralSeek\u2019s confidence in the automated response provided. High confidence suggests that the answer is likely cited by the documentation well, whereas low confidence infers that the resource material might have conflicting documentation or ambiguity. Both graphs are integral to data governance, directly reflecting the quality and reliability of the data used in generating answers. It is possible to have an accurate answer with low coverage but high confidence. It is also possible to have an inaccurate answer with high coverage and low confidence because the multiple resources have conflicting information. Color Coding : Coverage : Represented in shades of blue, with intensity varying based on coverage levels. The darker the shade, the more comprehensive documentation is referenced. Confidence : Indicated by green for high confidence and red for low confidence. Slope : The slope's height indicates the number of hits. A higher slope will show the majority of where the answers were bucketed - for example, if all the answers but one were scored at 99%, but there is one at 20%, the slope will be far larger at 99% and very small at 20%. By hovering over the graph, you can observe the trend of slope changes over time. In this case, there were instances of when the confidence had dropped from 83% to 22%, over the period between 14:07:31 to 14:12:15 on July 20th. Displaying Intents and Answers If you click the \u2304 Arrow next to the intent name, you will see the list of example questions and its generated answers: The example questions have either black color or gray color, depending on how they were created. The black colored examples are the ones that were actually submitted by the user's question. NeuralSeek automatically generates similar meaning questions per each question that it receives. As necessary, you can also enter your own Example question in addition to the ones that NeuralSeek generates. It is also possible to add Notes that may save additional information regarding this particular intent. Searching the intent The size of intent can vary but could grow over multiple pages, so you may want to search for a particular intent from time to time. You could do that by using the search form at the top of the page. Enter the keyword and it will narrow down your search. Filtering the intent There is a more fine-grained way of filtering intents based on criteria such as whether they were edited, or a new answer was added, flagged, or out-of-date data was found. Click the filter button, set the criterias that you want, and the page will only show the ones that meet the filtering condition. Editing the Answer On all the answers generated, a Subject Matter Expert can edit answers for both style and content. Edited answers automatically become training for the underlying LLM and will train the model on the style and content of the desired answer for that intent. Edited answers are also eligible for independant caching and can be directly served to the end user without going back to language genration. Editing can be done by clicking the answer, modifying its content, and saving it. After saving, you will see that the answer that you edited will be marked as Edited . Deleting Questions and Answers If you wish to delete either the question or answer under the intent, you can do so by clicking the circle with i icon and selecting Remove . \u26a0\ufe0f Once they are removed, there is no way to roll back the removal, so be careful. Deleting all data You can delete all data by selecting the gear icon at the top and selecting: Delete all data Delete all analytics Delete all unEdited Answers These are a useful feature if you wish to simply reset all of these data and start from the scratch. Intent operations When you select an intent, a popup will be displayed which shows you the operations that you can do with the selected intent. Edit category - will let you edit the current category Download to CSV - will export this into a CSV file. It will have the following format: ID,question,score,kbCoverage,answer,category,intent,pii Generate Conversation - This will convert the intent into conversation, instead of a simple question and answer. This will give a better context for the NeuralSeek to generate answers from. Flag - Will flag the intent so that you can quickly find it later. Rename - Will let you rename its name Delete - Deletes the selected intent(s). Backup - Backs up the intent for later recovery. Note that the backed up file is not a text file, but in binary format. Merge - appears only when two or more intents are selected. It merges all of their questions and answers into a single intent. Dynamic Personalization What is it? One way NeuralSeek quickly ties into the users business is by automatically personalizing results based on information from their Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. By analyzing user data such as past interactions, preferences, purchase history, and demographic information, NeuralSeek can dynamically adjust its outputs to match the specific needs and preferences of each individual user. Why is it important? Personalized answers tend to engage users more, and can result in higher satisfaction and containment. How does it work? This can be previewed in the Seek tab of the NeuralSeek UI, and in production environments users will pass the personalization details via our API as the REST call to when /seek is made. Entity Extraction What is it? NeuralSeek has a feature called Extract which is a service to let users extract entities within a given user text. Users can also define their custom entities and provide descriptions for NeuralSeek to detect and extract entities that are defined by users. The service is provided with a REST endpoint which can be used by external applications such as virtual agents or chat bots to invoke it within their conversational flow to enhance their capabilities to detect entities within it. Why is it important? Virtual Agents can define various entities, which may have values that need to be categorized into concepts or types that can play various roles during their request handling. For example, when a user types a question like: \u201cI would like to buy a movie ticket.\u201d The term \u201cmovie ticket\u201d could be categorized as \u201cproduct\u201d that the virtual agent might need to understand so that the agent could start a dialog that would continue like: \u201cSure, what kind of movie ticket do you want to purchase?\u201d Knowing that the user is interested in buying (intent) a movie ticket (product), the agent should perform an action of providing a list of the movies, as well as letting the user choose the date and time, and ultimately proceeding with billing and payment. The inherent challenge in configuring virtual agents is to make sure these entities are accurately identified by providing various patterns, values, or an entity type, so that when those words appear in the conversation, such entities can be identified. An example of that is how IBM Watson Assistant in dialog mode can define entity and its related values as such: In the above example, the entity \u2018product\u2019 would be identified in the dialog if the user mentioned these words such as \u2018movie reservation,\u2019 \u2018movie ticket,\u2019 or simply \u2018ticket.\u2019 Watson Assistant also provides fuzzy matching to match any incorrect spellings or slight deviation from these words to help it better cope with the request. However, there are obviously clear limitations and caveats in doing this approach. You have to provide every possible value necessary for the bot to understand it as a certain type of entity. Anything out of the given value might not be categorized at all, or even categorized incorrectly. Maintaining a large set of entities and its subsequent values can be costly and time consuming. If you have to support multiple languages, you may need to provide all the possible values as legal vocabularies which can then be a pretty challenging feat. How does it work? NeuralSeek\u2019s Entity Extraction uses natural language processing to extract key entities that your virtual agent needs to understand, without requiring you to specify possible values or patterns and having the burden of constantly maintaining it. Entity Extraction From Conversation Let\u2019s take a look at the above example of defining a movie ticket as a product. In the tab Extract, enter the same text of \u2018I would like to buy a movie ticket\u2019 and click the \u2018Extract\u2019 button. You will see NeuralSeek, without specifying anything, was able to identify the movie ticket as an entity of product and properly extracted it from the given string. Moreover, you can ask the phrase in different languages, and NeuralSeek\u2019s entity extraction will still work, without you doing anything! Custom Entities In case there is a specific way that you need to categorize an entity, NeuralSeek provides a simpler and better way to define what your entity is, by using Custom Entity definition. Using this, Neural Seek can perform entity extraction in much more robust way: And obviously, this single customer entity definition would work in other languages too! Entity Extraction REST API NeuralSeek\u2019s entity extraction supports integration via REST API, so it makes calling the service easy with any external applications such as virtual agents or chatbots. It is easy to test its functionality by using API documentation located under the Integrate tab.

When using webpages as documentation for the KnowledgeBase, nuisance information such as banners and cookies will deteriorate information relevant to the users organization. The Automatic Data Cleansing feature of NeuralSeek will automatically cleanse the web pages that were scraped, exposing information pertinent to the organization, at the users own pace. Why is it important? Condensing and focusing the information, while removing useless wording returned by the KnowledgeBase is critical to high quality answer generation. Most web content is not great at directly answering questions because of the amount of nuisance webpage language that gets extracted with the core content. How does it work? NeuralSeek will identify documents in the KnowledgeBase that come from webscrapes. NeuralSeek will then run its own algorithm against the full webpage HTML to extract just the core content and remove as much of the extraneous information as possible. Caching What is it? NeuralSeek uses caching strategy in two areas (Corporate KnowledgeBase and Answer) to enhance performance and reduce computational cost during its operation. Why is it important? Caching frequently returned answers saves both time and computation cost to run virtual agents, as it reduces NeuralSeek having to generate responses repeatedly, especially on the more frequently asked questions or seldom updated answers. How does it work? The first part is when NeuralSeek searches through the corporate knowledge base to obtain the original information. You can set the cache duration of such responses to be cached, so that the original information\u2019s retrieval time can be reduced. NeuralSeek then utilizes two types of caches for both your edited answers and generated answers that can serve cached answers to user questions in order to speed up response times and produce more consistent results. Corporate KnowledgeBase Cache When NeuralSeek accesses the Corporate KnowledgeBase, it processes the original data from it, cleanses its contents (e.g. removing unnecessary contents, filtering, deduplicating, etc.), compresses it, and prioritize the returned contents which is then processed with LLM (Large Language Model) to form the completed response, usually at the range of 8,000 ~ 9,000 characters. It then derives a hash value of that response window which acts as a check to later see if the original data is updated. This response is what actually gets cached within NeuralSeek, so that all the search, processing, and LLM-generated time is effectively saved when the same answer needs to be derived. Under the Configure > Corporate KnowledgeBase Details section, user can set the duration of the cache measured in minutes to control how long these responses need to be cached. Answer Cache When the user asks a question to NeuralSeek, it tries to use the question to find the matching \u2018intent\u2019 of the question. And when the matching intent is discovered (usually via fuzzy matching), the provided answer, either normal or user edited, can then be cached. Under the Configure > Intent Matching & Cache Configuration section, you can enable or disable the edited answer cache or normal answer cache, and set the following parameters to control how it works: Each cache type (edited answer, normal) would have the answer threshold bar and edited answer match tolerance. You can adjust the threshold to control when the caching will start caching for the answer, depending on how many answers exist for a given user question. For example, if you set the threshold to 5, the caching will not start until there exist 5 or more different answers to the given question. Setting the threshold to 1 would let NeuralSeek start caching as soon as it sees at least a single answer exists. Setting the value to 0 will disable caching completely. The matching method (Exact Match, Fuzzy Match, etc.) is the method you can specify to tell NeuralSeek on how to perform the intent matching on the question. There is also a more advanced matching method of \u2018Exact Match, exact conversational context\u2019 on the normal answers that would try to find the match if the consecutive conversation (e.g. one and the one after) both have the matching result, so that the match could be more correct in terms of how the conversation flow is occurring. In terms of the edited answers, this \u2018conversational context\u2019 matching is not provided given that the edited answers should be more concise and based on a more substantial ground and thus should not rely on the conversational context. Detecting changes in the original source In order to make sure the cached answers retain the authenticity, every cached answers are fed into a hashing algorithm to generate a unique hash key, which is then compared with the original source to detect whether the original source has been altered or not. If the hash keys do not match, NeuralSeek will notify users that the answers are not up-to-date with what\u2019s found in the KnowledgeBase. This would happen when a particular answer is being used during the Seek time, so that the answer would be kept in check with the original. Users can then take a look at the outdated answer, and can either delete and reload it, or edit it and then mark it as current, so that NeuralSeek will be able to check it off from its outdated list. One other way the answer would be checked is when NeuralSeek is handling round trip logging. During that time, NeuralSeek would check which answers are getting frequently returned and also perform asynchronous checks with the KnowledgeBase to make sure they are up-to-date. How do we know the answers are coming from cache? You can check whether your query matched and returned the cached answer in the Seek tab. For example, this is an example of the answer returned from the cache. Next to the Total Response Time , you will see a label Cached which indicates that the answer came straight from the cache. Content Analytics What is it? NeuralSeek incorporates content analytics as a built-in feature, eliminating the need for additional code. With Content Analytics in NeuralSeek, users can effortlessly gather information about what users are searching for, assess the extent of documentation available on those topics, and evaluate documentation efficiency in addressing user queries. Why is it important? Content Analytics are a powerful feature that enable insight on the performance of your corporate documentation. You can gain insights on where content is excellent, underperforming, nonexistent or seldom used - and inform the groups responsible for creating or updating that information on how better to allocate their time. How does it work? Two main scores are returned when a user asks a question to NeuralSeek: Coverage Score: This score represents the number of documents or sections of documents that discuss the subject area(s) of a question from NeuralSeek. Confidence Score: The confidence score represents the likelihood that the information found in the KnowledgeBase of NeuralSeek and presented as a response is correct. This probability is given as a percentage. Low scoring questions with low coverage scores tend to mean there is little or no documentation on the subject. Low scoring questions with high coverage tends to mean there are conflicting source documents.","title":"Data Management"},{"location":"main_features/data_management/data_management/#automatic-data-cleansing-and-preparation","text":"What is it? When using webpages as documentation for the KnowledgeBase, nuisance information such as banners and cookies will deteriorate information relevant to the users organization. The Automatic Data Cleansing feature of NeuralSeek will automatically cleanse the web pages that were scraped, exposing information pertinent to the organization, at the users own pace. Why is it important? Condensing and focusing the information, while removing useless wording returned by the KnowledgeBase is critical to high quality answer generation. Most web content is not great at directly answering questions because of the amount of nuisance webpage language that gets extracted with the core content. How does it work? NeuralSeek will identify documents in the KnowledgeBase that come from webscrapes. NeuralSeek will then run its own algorithm against the full webpage HTML to extract just the core content and remove as much of the extraneous information as possible.","title":"Automatic Data Cleansing and Preparation"},{"location":"main_features/data_management/data_management/#caching","text":"What is it? NeuralSeek uses caching strategy in two areas (Corporate KnowledgeBase and Answer) to enhance performance and reduce computational cost during its operation. Why is it important? Caching frequently returned answers saves both time and computation cost to run virtual agents, as it reduces NeuralSeek having to generate responses repeatedly, especially on the more frequently asked questions or seldom updated answers. How does it work? The first part is when NeuralSeek searches through the corporate knowledge base to obtain the original information. You can set the cache duration of such responses to be cached, so that the original information\u2019s retrieval time can be reduced. NeuralSeek then utilizes two types of caches for both your edited answers and generated answers that can serve cached answers to user questions in order to speed up response times and produce more consistent results.","title":"Caching"},{"location":"main_features/data_management/data_management/#corporate-knowledgebase-cache","text":"When NeuralSeek accesses the Corporate KnowledgeBase, it processes the original data from it, cleanses its contents (e.g. removing unnecessary contents, filtering, deduplicating, etc.), compresses it, and prioritize the returned contents which is then processed with LLM (Large Language Model) to form the completed response, usually at the range of 8,000 ~ 9,000 characters. It then derives a hash value of that response window which acts as a check to later see if the original data is updated. This response is what actually gets cached within NeuralSeek, so that all the search, processing, and LLM-generated time is effectively saved when the same answer needs to be derived. Under the Configure > Corporate KnowledgeBase Details section, user can set the duration of the cache measured in minutes to control how long these responses need to be cached.","title":"Corporate KnowledgeBase Cache"},{"location":"main_features/data_management/data_management/#answer-cache","text":"When the user asks a question to NeuralSeek, it tries to use the question to find the matching \u2018intent\u2019 of the question. And when the matching intent is discovered (usually via fuzzy matching), the provided answer, either normal or user edited, can then be cached. Under the Configure > Intent Matching & Cache Configuration section, you can enable or disable the edited answer cache or normal answer cache, and set the following parameters to control how it works: Each cache type (edited answer, normal) would have the answer threshold bar and edited answer match tolerance. You can adjust the threshold to control when the caching will start caching for the answer, depending on how many answers exist for a given user question. For example, if you set the threshold to 5, the caching will not start until there exist 5 or more different answers to the given question. Setting the threshold to 1 would let NeuralSeek start caching as soon as it sees at least a single answer exists. Setting the value to 0 will disable caching completely. The matching method (Exact Match, Fuzzy Match, etc.) is the method you can specify to tell NeuralSeek on how to perform the intent matching on the question. There is also a more advanced matching method of \u2018Exact Match, exact conversational context\u2019 on the normal answers that would try to find the match if the consecutive conversation (e.g. one and the one after) both have the matching result, so that the match could be more correct in terms of how the conversation flow is occurring. In terms of the edited answers, this \u2018conversational context\u2019 matching is not provided given that the edited answers should be more concise and based on a more substantial ground and thus should not rely on the conversational context.","title":"Answer Cache"},{"location":"main_features/data_management/data_management/#detecting-changes-in-the-original-source","text":"In order to make sure the cached answers retain the authenticity, every cached answers are fed into a hashing algorithm to generate a unique hash key, which is then compared with the original source to detect whether the original source has been altered or not. If the hash keys do not match, NeuralSeek will notify users that the answers are not up-to-date with what\u2019s found in the KnowledgeBase. This would happen when a particular answer is being used during the Seek time, so that the answer would be kept in check with the original. Users can then take a look at the outdated answer, and can either delete and reload it, or edit it and then mark it as current, so that NeuralSeek will be able to check it off from its outdated list. One other way the answer would be checked is when NeuralSeek is handling round trip logging. During that time, NeuralSeek would check which answers are getting frequently returned and also perform asynchronous checks with the KnowledgeBase to make sure they are up-to-date.","title":"Detecting changes in the original source"},{"location":"main_features/data_management/data_management/#how-do-we-know-the-answers-are-coming-from-cache","text":"You can check whether your query matched and returned the cached answer in the Seek tab.

NeuralSeek incorporates content analytics as a built-in feature, eliminating the need for additional code. With Content Analytics in NeuralSeek, users can effortlessly gather information about what users are searching for, assess the extent of documentation available on those topics, and evaluate documentation efficiency in addressing user queries. Why is it important? Content Analytics are a powerful feature that enable insight on the performance of your corporate documentation. You can gain insights on where content is excellent, underperforming, nonexistent or seldom used - and inform the groups responsible for creating or updating that information on how better to allocate their time. How does it work? Two main scores are returned when a user asks a question to NeuralSeek: Coverage Score: This score represents the number of documents or sections of documents that discuss the subject area(s) of a question from NeuralSeek. Confidence Score: The confidence score represents the likelihood that the information found in the KnowledgeBase of NeuralSeek and presented as a response is correct.

NeuralSeek provides a service that would analyze and identify the language of a given text. Why is it important? Any application that would need to understand which language a given text is can now use NeuralSeek to do it, rather than relying on other external services. How does it work? Language identification is provided as REST API, and can be tested on NeuralSeek API documentation . Message payload is in text/plain format, and contains text in certain languages. An example message would look something like this: \uc774 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub294 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc785\ub2c8\uae4c? NeuralSeek would then identify what language this is in, and returns the language code and the confidence score: [ { \"language\" : \"ko\" , \"confidence\" : 0.95 } ] Intent Categorization What is it? NeuralSeek can automatically categorize user input and questions into categories. These categories can be anything - products, organizations, departments, etc. Users can set up categories on the Configure Tab, by entering category names and descriptions. These will then be used to match user input into categories. User inputs that do not match any category, or that too closely match multiple categories will be placed in a default category called \"Other\". This default category cannot be modified. Why is it important? Categorization is very useful at scaling NeuralSeek within an organization. By grouping intents into categories it can make things much easier for subject matter experts to quickly take action on their specific area of content. Categorization can be useful even outside the context of answering user questions - for example, in routing customer questions to the correct department or live agent. Categorization can be called directly via the API. How does it work? User input is scored and bucketed based on the category title and description, and based on intents that have been manually moved into categories (self-learning). Once categorization is enabled, the Curate and Analytics screens will change to show groupings around categories. Categorization is not retroactive - meaning if you define a new category, we will not automatically re-run all old user input against the new categories. Users may move intents into categories manually through the Curate tab or the CSV download/edit features. The edits made will be used to train the system for future categorization events. Language Translation What is it? NeuralSeek provides language translation that will let users call it to translate languages into different languages. Why is it important? Any application that would need to translate a given text to another language can now use NeuralSeek to do it, rather than relying on other external translation services. How does it work? Translation is provided as REST API, and can be tested on NeuralSeek API documentation . Message payload is in JSON format, and contains an array of text in certain language(s). Another attribute is target which specifies the target language the translation needs to be performed in. An example message would look something like this: { \"text\" : [ \"NeuralSeek introduced several new features in July 2023, including streaming responses for web use cases, enhanced cross-lingual support, curate to CSV/upload curated QA from CSV, improved semantic match analysis, updated IBM WatsonX model compatibility, and AWS Lex round-trip monitoring.\" ], \"target\" : \"ko\" }, For more details on what language codes are supported, please refer to Multi Language Support .

NeuralSeek has several different language options available for understanding questions and delivering answers. These include English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Arabic, Korean, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, Indonesian, Japanese, and more. These can be adjusted on the \u201cConfigure\u201d section of the NeuralSeek console, or on the \u201cSeek\u201d endpoint. Please see the below table for the full list of supported languages. Why is it important? Instead of having to train your virtual agents to understand various different languages, your question can be automatically converted into the response in the language of your choice. How does it work? NeuralSeek will try to determine if the user is asking a question in a certain language (e.g. Spanish), and will try to convert the responses into the language that the user asked without any additional set ups.

On the \u201cSeek\u201d endpoint, click the dropdown for language navigation and click \"Match Input\". Specifying a Language If you would like to specify a certain target language that you want NeuralSeek to generate answers into, you can do so by specifying a language code (e.g. es) in the request when you are invoking Seek . The same can be achieved when you are invoking Seek using REST API. You can specify the language under the options > language . Cross-language support for KBs NeuralSeek offers robust multi-language support, allowing users to interact with a knowledge base (KB) in a different language than the one the KB is written in. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the knowledge base is in one language (e.g., English), but users need to query it in another language (e.g., Spanish). How It Works When a user queries the knowledge base in a different language, NeuralSeek handles the translation process seamlessly: User Query in Native Language : The user asks a question in their native language (e.g., Spanish). Translation to KB Language : NeuralSeek translates the user's question into the language of the knowledge base (e.g., English). Querying the KB : The translated question is used to search the knowledge base. Retrieving the Answer : NeuralSeek retrieves the answer from the LLM in their native language. Delivering the Response : The user receives the response in their native language. Example Scenario Question in Spanish, KB in English User Query : \"\u00bfCu\u00e1l es la capital de Francia?\" Translate to English : \"What is the capital of France?\" Query the English KB : The system searches for \"What is the capital of France?\" in the English knowledge base. Retrieve Answer from the LLM in Spanish : \"La capital de Francia es Par\u00eds.\" Deliver Response : \"La capital de Francia es Par\u00eds.\" Implementation Steps To configure NeuralSeek for multi-language support, follow these steps: Step 1: Configure the Knowledge Base Language Navigate to the Configure Tab : Access the configuration settings of NeuralSeek. Select the Language of Your Knowledge Base : Choose the language your knowledge base is written in (English, in this case). Save the Configuration : Ensure that your settings are saved properly to apply the changes. Step 2: Testing Multi-Language Queries Go to the Seek Tab : Access the query interface of NeuralSeek. Enter a Question in Spanish : Test the configuration by entering a question in Spanish, such as \"\u00bfCu\u00e1l es la capital de Francia?\" Observe the Response : NeuralSeek should translate the question, query the English knowledge base, and return the response in the desired language: \"La capital de Francia es Par\u00eds.\" Conclusion NeuralSeek's multi-language support allows for flexible and user-friendly interactions with knowledge bases, regardless of the language barrier. By translating queries and responses, NeuralSeek ensures that users receive accurate and contextually relevant information in their native language.","title":"Language Capabilities"},{"location":"main_features/language_capabilities/language_capabilities/#identify-language","text":"What is it?

The home page is where users can get started interacting with NeuralSeek and quickly set up a chatbot in a matter of moments (see NeuralSeek onboarding). Why is it important? The home page of NeuralSeek is a crucial feature for swift chatbot deployment. Users can efficiently set up their virtual agents by providing organization details, connecting to their KnowledgeBase, and selecting a preferred Large Language Model. The option to configure organization details, tune documentation parameters, and auto-generate actions streamlines the process. Additionally, NeuralSeek addresses a common challenge by offering automated question generation based on the KnowledgeBase content, saving time and improving interaction quality. The ability to input, categorize, and review questions, along with uploading test questions for analytics, makes it an indispensable tool for users aiming to create effective and responsive virtual agents in a matter of moments. How does it work? Basics : User provides general information about their organization with NeuralSeek. Data : Where users connect to their KnowledgeBase (can also be done under the \u201cConfigure\u201d tab). LLM : (only available with Bring Your Own LLM plan) Users can select their preferred LLM (Large Language Model) of choice. Users are required to enter the appropriate integration information (e.g. API key of their LLM) in order to continue. About: Describing the organization and use case preferences. Tune: Provide information about the documentation/KnowledgeBase. Q&A: Auto-generate a list of actions to set up a virtual agent in minutes. User can also perform the following actions through the home page: Auto-generate questions : Virtual Agents would typically require an adequate number of questions for creating meaningful intentions and dialogs. This process would typically involve having to manually create them. However, NeuralSeek can generate, based on the contents of your KnowledgeBase, a good set of commonly asked questions for you. Manually Input questions : If you already have a good set of questions that your user frequently asks, you can upload them into NeuralSeek and NeuralSeek could categorize and create their answers for you to later review and curate them. Upload Test questions : If you want to test out your set of questions, and validate whether their coverage or confidence score is good enough, or find out how their analytics look like, use this. A template CSV file is given for you to use it. Configure What is it? The Configure tab allows users to modify settings for NeuralSeek features. Why is it important? This functionality allows for a highly customizable and adaptable user experience, enabling organizations to optimize the performance of NeuralSeek in accordance with their unique use cases. Whether it involves adjusting default configurations for standard use or delving into advanced configurations for more nuanced preferences, the \"Configure\" tab empowers users to fine-tune NeuralSeek's capabilities. This level of customization ensures that NeuralSeek becomes a versatile and effective tool, capable of delivering optimal results across diverse organizational contexts. How does it work? For more information refer to our Reference Material - Configuration section. Integrate What is it? The Integrate tab provides users with detailed instruction on integration of NeuralSeek with selected Virtual Agents, WebHook, API, or self-hosted LLM. Why is it important? NeuralSeek provides comprehensive guidance on selected integrations which allows for a more user-friendly experience. How does it work? The Integrate tab on NeuralSeek's user interface provides step-by-step instructions on how to connect to various virtual agent frameworks. Once connected, users are able to call on NeuralSeek through the chosen framework as either a \"fallback intent\" or other action.

Secret/Zen Key: The Service provider's secondary key (only for some providers) Endpoint: The endpoint URL for the selected service. Region: The region where the LLM service is provisioned. Project Id: The project ID for the LLM workspace. LLLM Languages: Enable or disable specific languages to be used with the selected LLM. LLM Functions: Enable or disable specific functions for each LLM, essentially selecting which LLM to use for each task, or allowing load-balancing for specific tasks. E.g. one option is to use a specific LLM for seek , and a different LLM for maistro or translate , allowing for flexible and specific use cases. LLM ID: The ID/internal name of the selected LLM. Use this ID on API calls or from mAIstro. Test: Run a test completion against the LLM, verifying the credentials. This does not 'save' , you must still 'save' your settings with the main UI button. Delete: Remove the selected LLM from the configuration. Note This section is only available if you are using BYOLLM (bring your own LLM) plan of NeuralSeek. Not all LLM providers are equal - All options are listed here, even though your provider may not need these specific parameters. Company/Organization Preferences This is where you can configure your company name, and description of what the company primarily focuses on. Company or Organization Name: This field is used to help align user queries to the company KB. E.g., \"How do I use your product?\" will target towards this value. Company Response Affinity: Enable to add affinity to your company or brand in addition to existing text that may be already present in your KnowledgeBase and Stump Speeches. Stump Speech: Effectively an \"always pinned document\" that is included in the documentation for every seek call. This helps answer questions as a fallback knowledge source when the user's search fails to produce relevant documentation. Platform Preferences Your one-stop-shop for all platform-related preferences. Set timeouts, configure embedded links, Virtual Agent output format, etc. Timeout: Set this to a few seconds less than the timeout of your chatbot platform. When the timeout is reached, NeuralSeek will attempt to respond with a cached answer if available. Context Turns: The number of turns in the conversation to pass to the LLM. Increasing this is not recommended as it will reduce the LLM context available for your documentation. Default Output Language: The language to reply in. Setting the language value on the API will override this parameter. Set to \"Match input\" to try and identify the input language and respond in that detected language. Translate to KB Language: When enabled, translate queries into the language selected on the KnowledgeBase. Virtual Agent Type: Select the type of Virtual Agent for curation of answers. This is the format NeuralSeek will use to build the chatbot file. Embed Links into returned responses: Enable to embed clickable links into the seek generated answers on the API side. Custom Stopwords List: Stop Words - A list of \"not useful\" or insignificant words to remove pre-processing. Add words here to override NeuralSeek's list of stopwords. Intent Categorization Create types of categories and with natural language descriptions to control how intents in user questions can be categorized. Usually a question would be automatically categorized as FAQ , but you can provide additional custom categories here. Category: The name of the category. URL/Link: The link to return for answers in this category. This overrides the URL returned from the documentation source. Description: A natural language description of the category. E.g. \"Breed of dog, like Yorkie or Labrador.\" Governance and Guardrails Settings related to governance, prompt protection, profanity filtering, etc Attribute Checking Adjust misinformation tolerance for generating text about the company, or associating people or things that lack specific references in the KnowledgeBase material by using the sliding scale from \"Rigid\" to \"Standard\". The more rigid your settings, the higher the chances of occasionally blocking legitimate questions that use alternate wording or are poorly documented in your KnowledgeBase. Semantic Score Toggle the icons to enable or disable the Semantic Score Model, using Semantic Score as the basis for Warning & Minimum confidence (e.g. Do NOT Enable for use cases requiring language translation), re-ranking the search results based on the Semantic Match, and checking the document titles and URL's as part of the Semantic Match. Note that semantic scoring will not be accurate when getting answers in a different language than your KnowledgeBase source docs. Enable the Semantic Score Model: The Semantic Score model compares the generated answer against the KnowledgeBase sources, and rates the answer based on the quantity and focus of matches to the KnowledgeBase and Stump Speech source documentation (e.g. is the answer primarily formed from a single source or many?) Use Semantic Score as the basis for Warning/Minimum: Enabling this uses the Semantic Score for warning/minimum confidence settings. Disabling will use the KB confidence % instead. Not recommended for non-English use-cases Re-rank search results based on Semantic Match: Re-order the KnowledgeBase documentation snippets based on how well the passage matches the answer given. Check document titles as part of the Semantic Match: Include the document title while calculating the Semantic Match Score. Check document URLs as part of the Semantic Match: Include the document URL while calculating the Semantic Match Score. Semantic Model Tuning: Use the sliding scales to further tune the Semantic Match. Missing key search term penalty: After scoring, this penalty is applied for answers that are missing KnowledgeBase attribution of proper nouns that were included in the search. Missing search term penalty: After scoring, this penalty is applied for answers that are missing KnowledgeBase attribution of other nouns that were included in the search. Source Jump penalty: When answers join across many source documents it can be an indication of lost meaning or intent, depending on your source documentation. Total Coverage weight: Looking at the answer, how much weight should be given to the total coverage alone, regardless of other penalty. Increasing this helps prevent abnormally low scores from long, highly-stitched answers. Decreasing will better catch hallucination in short answers. Re-Rank Min Coverage %: What is the minimum coverage of the total answer that the top used source document needs to be re-ranked over the top KB-scored document. Prompt Injection Mitigation Users are able to block malicious attempts from users trying to get the LLM to respond in disruptive, embarrassing, or harmful ways. Prompt Injection Threshold: A sliding scale to block any inputs that score higher than this percentage against the Prompt Injection model. Blocked Word Action: Either remove the offending words from the user input, or block the question altogether. Blocked Word List: Enter words or phrases (separated by commas) that are not allowed on the user input. This is useful for blocking specific competitive customer or product names, as well as other sensitive words not covered by NeuralSeek's base corpus. Profanity Filter / HAP (Hate, Abuse, Profanity) Filter Users are able to enable or disable the profanity filter, as well as add a text to reply with for sensitive questions that are blocked. Enable profanity filter: Choose which filter to use for profanity filtering. You may use the LLM's moderation endpoint if available, the NeuralSeek Filter, or disable it. Blocked reply text: The text to show when the input or question is blocked. E.g. \"That seems like a sensitive question.\" Warning Confidence Use the sliding scale to increase the confidence threshold. Confidence %: Any answers lower than this number will have the below text pre-pended to the answer given. Warning text: The text to pre-pend to the answer given. Minimum Confidence Use the sliding scale to increase the minimum confidence percentage and the minimum confidence percentage to display a URL. Add a text to reply with for questions not meeting the minimum confidence, and select whether to add a URL fallback on minimum. (e.g. \"There is nothing in our knowledge base about that.\"). Minimum Confidence %: Any answers lower than this number will have the below text substituted in place of the answer. Reply text: The response to give when answers are below the minimum confidence % set. Minimum Confidence % to display a URL: Any answers lower than this number will not return a linked URL. URL Fallback Optional - A URL to offer when the minimum confidence is not met. Minimum Text Use the sliding scale to set a desired minimum amount of words in a question. Minimum Words: The minimum number of words in a user question/input. Reply Text: Add a text to reply with for questions not meeting the minimum input word length. (e.g. \"Give me a bit more to go on...\"). Maximum Length Use the sliding scale to set a desired maximum amount of words in a question. Maximum Words: The maximum number of words in a user question/input. Set to 100 to remove the limit. Use a low limit to help mitigate adversarial questions designed to generate inappropriate answers. Reply Text: Add a text to reply with for questions over the input word limit. (e.g. \"Can you please summarize your question for me? Questions should be limited to 20 words.\"). Advanced Configuration These (expanded) options are available after enabling \"Show advanced options\" from the default configuration. KnowledgeBase Tuning Tuning your KnowledgeBase is an important part of creating a well performing system. Document Score Range: The upper range score of documents to return. E.g. when set to 0.8 or 80% , return the top scoring 80% of documents, discarding the lowest 20% scored documents. The smaller the number, the more strict the score threshold will be. Generally best set to a high number, used with Max Docs setting. Document Date Penalty: Penalize document scores that include old dates. A higher number means a higher penalty for older documents, scaling with time/age. KB Query Cache: Limit repeated queries to the KnowledgeBase by caching KB queries. Set this to the number of minutes you'd like to preserve cached KB queries. Max Documents per Seek: The number of documents to send to the LLM on each Seek action. Generally the best results are seen with this set to 4-5 documents. Snippet Size: The character count to pass to the KB for document passage size. The larger the number, the bigger the documentation chunk. Generally best as a smaller number - around 500. Max Raw Score: The highest all-time document score NeuralSeek has seen from the KB. NeuralSeek uses this number internally to calculate a 100% score for documents. Hybrid and Vector Search Settings Offering the ability to choose from searching with Lucene, Vector, or a Hybrid approach Query Type: The type of query that NeuralSeek will use to gather source documentation. Lucene: \"Exact match\" queries. Vector: Vector similarity search, based on your deployed Vector model. Hybrid: A combined search query that slightly boosts Lucene results, allowing for graceful fallback to Vector results if no exact matches are found. Use the Elastic ELSER model? The query format is different using ELSER vs deployed KNN models. Select False if not using Elastic's ELSER model. ELSER - Model ID: The name of the deployed and running model. ELSER - Embedding Field: The name of the metadata field where the generated Vector embeddings are stored. Elastic KNN Query: The JSON of the KNN Vector query to run. There are a couple values to set within the JSON: field: The name of the metadata field where the Vector embeddings are stored. model_id: The name of the deployed and running model. model_text: We offer a << query >> expansion variable to insert the query generated by NeuralSeek. Useful to edit if some Vector models require a specific format, e.g. question: <<query>> See the Elastic documentation for more info around the other available parameters. Prompt Engineering This allows expert users to inject specific instructions into the base LLM prompt. Most use cases will not need this and should not use this. (e.g. do not enter \"provide factual information\" or \"act as a helpful customer support agent\". NeuralSeek's extensive prompting already does this.) Do not casually enable, as you can weaken the safeguards and extensive prompting that NeuralSeek provides out-of-the-box. Do not use any language other than English in prompt engineering. Prompt Instructions: Text to add to the end of the LLM prompt. This can rarely be helpful, but some examples might be \"Answer with a bulleted list if possible\", or \"Answer in cowboy dialect\". Answer Engineering and Preferences Customizing answer engineering and setting preferences provides adaptability to different contexts. Answer Verbosity Utilize the sliding scales to set whether the answer generation would stick to being concise and short, or offer more freedom to be flexible and wordy. Force Answers from the KnowledgeBase: Enable to add extra prompting to help \"force\" the answers from returned documentation. Generally best to keep this enabled. Regular Expressions: Click the light bulb icon to add a new row. Input a regular expression and a corresponding replacement. For example, use this feature to remove or swap phone numbers, emails, etc. Intent Matching and Cache Configuration NeuralSeek automatically generates and groups user input into intents. When a user input does not match an existing intent, the question is added to the generic FAQ group. The following types of intent matches are available: Exact Match: The user input exactly matches an intent. Vector Similarity: Compare the vector similarity of the user input to existing intents, matching with similar intents. Utilize the \"Try it Out\" feature to test intent similarity. Input an example sentence and click the 'Test' button. The output will show similar intent pulled from the Curate tab and a corresponding similarity score. Utilize the \"Intent Match Threshold\" sliding scale to set the minimum match percentage to match an existing Intent. Fuzzy Match: The user input closely matches an intent, but not exactly. Keyword Match: The user input contains keywords that exactly match keywords in an intent. Fuzzy Keyword Match: The user input contains keywords that closely match an intent. Users can also configure how the answer caching is to be done for edited answers, and normal answers. This is useful for speeding up response times and producing more consistent results. Edited Answer Cache: Define the minimum amount of edited answers before language generation stops, and cached answers are served. Set the scale to '0' to disable the edited answer cache. Normal Answer Cache: Define the minimum amount of normal language generated answers to store before language generation stops, and cached answers are served. Set the scale to '0' to disable the edited answer cache. Note Edited answers have priority in the Normal Answer Cache, followed by the most recent generated answer. Table Understanding This pre-processes your documents to extract and parse tabular data into a format suitable for conversational query. Since this preparation process is both costly and time-consuming, this feature is opt-in and will consume 1 seek query for every table preprocessed. Web Crawl Collections are not eligible for table understanding, as the re-crawl interval will cause excessive compute usage. Table preparation time takes several minutes per page. Please contact cloud@cerebralblue.com with details of your opportunity and use case to be considered for access. Discovery Collection IDs: Click the light bulb icon to add a new row. Input the desired collection ID from Watson Discovery for table preparation. Note Table Understanding requires a compatible LLM with Table Understanding Enabled. Not all LLMs are capable of Table Understanding. Personal Identifiable Information (PII) Handling Users can define how to handle any detected PII data that was included in the question. The following actions to take when PII is found on user input are available: Mask: Mask, and store, PII when it is detected in the user input. Masking will hide the PII in all locations. Flag: Flag, and store, for PII when it is detected in the user input. PII will be flagged in all locations. No Action: No action will be taken when PII is detected in the user input. It will be stored in plain text. Hide (retain for Analytics): Hide (mask) the PII when it is detected in the user input, but keep the PII in the database for Analytics. Delete (including from Analytics): Delete the PII entirely when it is detected in the user input, including from the stored Analytics. The configuration also lets you add any particular examples of PII data, so it can be better detected. Pre-LLM PII Filters: These run dynamically on user input before it is sent to the LLM or KnowledgeBase. Click the light bulb icon to add a description such as a phone number and a corresponding regular expression. LLM - Based PII Filters: These use the chosen LLM to identify PII. Click the light bulb icon to add an example sentence and corresponding PII elements, separated by commas. Some of NeuralSeek's PII Detectors are shown here: Note Utilize the \"Try it Out\" feature to test the set PII filters. Input an example sentence and click the 'Test' button. The output will show the test sentence, a true or false response if PII was detected, and what element of the sentence was detected as PII. Corporate Document Filter Connect NeuralSeek to an external corporate rules engine to filter allowed documentation by user. Each request will send the ID's of the found documentation to an endpoint you set here. Any IDs not returned from the corporate filter will be blocked. Enable Corporate Filter: If enabled, fill out all relevant information including: Base URL for the corporate filter (get): The URL of the corporate document filter engine. URL parameter for the UserName: The parameter name for the user's ID. URL parameter for the KB field: The parameter name for the \"document ID\" for permission filtering. KnowledgeBase field to send: The KB metadata field to send as the \"document ID\". Corporate Logging Connect NeuralSeek to a corporate audit logging endpoint. When connected and enabled, all requests and responses to the Seek API endpoint, as well as the Curate tab will be logged to your Elasticsearch instance. Users are able to log the full LLM \"Seek\" prompt for Audit and Compliance reasons. Enable Corporate Logging: Toggle the icon to Enable or Disable this feature. If enabled, fill out all relevant information including: Elasticsearch Endpoint and Elasticsearch API Key. Prompt Logging: Type \"agree\" into the provided box to agree to the provided Non-Disclosure Agreement and enable prompt logging.

Test the Integration Go to the Seek tab in NeuralSeek and perform a search to verify if the integration works. Additionally, you can test the setup using Maistro. Technical Explanation: How Pinecone and NeuralSeek Work Together Pinecone Pinecone is a vector database that provides efficient similarity search and retrieval capabilities. In the context of NeuralSeek, Pinecone serves as the knowledge base where all documents and their vector embeddings are stored. Key functionalities include: Indexing Pinecone indexes vector embeddings of documents, making them easily searchable. Querying It processes search queries by comparing query vectors with stored document vectors to find the most similar matches. Scalability Pinecone can handle large volumes of data and provides quick search responses, making it suitable for extensive knowledge bases. NeuralSeek Embedding Model NeuralSeek uses sophisticated embedding models to generate vector representations of text data. The infloat-e5-small-v2 model, in particular, transforms text into a 384-dimensional vector, capturing the semantic meaning of the text. Key functionalities include: Text Embeddings Converts text data into dense vector representations that capture semantic information. Similarity Matching Compares query vectors with document vectors to find the most relevant answers. Contextual Understanding Leverages multiple layers to understand and generate contextually accurate responses. Integration Workflow Data Ingestion : Documents are ingested and processed to generate vector embeddings using NeuralSeek\u2019s embedding model. Indexing : The generated vector embeddings are stored in Pinecone, where they are indexed for efficient search and retrieval. Query Processing : When a query is entered, NeuralSeek converts the query text into a vector using the embedding model. Search and Retrieval : The query vector is compared with document vectors in Pinecone to find the most relevant matches. Response Generation : The most relevant documents are retrieved from Pinecone, and NeuralSeek formulates a response based on the retrieved data. Benefits of This Configuration Efficiency Combining Pinecone\u2019s efficient vector search capabilities with NeuralSeek\u2019s powerful embeddings ensures quick and accurate responses. Scalability Pinecone can scale to handle large data volumes, while NeuralSeek\u2019s embeddings maintain high performance. Accuracy NeuralSeek\u2019s contextual embeddings improve the accuracy of responses, providing relevant and precise information. Troubleshooting Issue: Model Not Providing Accurate Responses Solution : Verify the model parameters and ensure that the content in the knowledge base is up-to-date. Issue: Upload Errors Solution : Ensure that file formats are correct and data integrity is maintained. Issue: Integration Issues Solution : Recheck the linkage between the model and the knowledge base, and verify that synchronization is correctly configured.","title":"Configuration Details"},{"location":"reference_material/configuration/configuration/#overview","text":"This location of NeuralSeek is where users can edit the configurations for NeuralSeek\u2019s features.

Use Semantic Score as the basis for Warning/Minimum: Enabling this uses the Semantic Score for warning/minimum confidence settings. Disabling will use the KB confidence % instead. Not recommended for non-English use-cases Re-rank search results based on Semantic Match: Re-order the KnowledgeBase documentation snippets based on how well the passage matches the answer given. Check document titles as part of the Semantic Match: Include the document title while calculating the Semantic Match Score. Check document URLs as part of the Semantic Match: Include the document URL while calculating the Semantic Match Score. Semantic Model Tuning: Use the sliding scales to further tune the Semantic Match. Missing key search term penalty: After scoring, this penalty is applied for answers that are missing KnowledgeBase attribution of proper nouns that were included in the search. Missing search term penalty: After scoring, this penalty is applied for answers that are missing KnowledgeBase attribution of other nouns that were included in the search. Source Jump penalty: When answers join across many source documents it can be an indication of lost meaning or intent, depending on your source documentation. Total Coverage weight: Looking at the answer, how much weight should be given to the total coverage alone, regardless of other penalty. Increasing this helps prevent abnormally low scores from long, highly-stitched answers. Decreasing will better catch hallucination in short answers. Re-Rank Min Coverage %: What is the minimum coverage of the total answer that the top used source document needs to be re-ranked over the top KB-scored document.","title":"Semantic Score"},{"location":"reference_material/configuration/configuration/#prompt-injection-mitigation","text":"Users are able to block malicious attempts from users trying to get the LLM to respond in disruptive, embarrassing, or harmful ways.

NeuralSeek will automatically generate IBM Watson Assistant \u201cActions\u201d or \u201cDialogs,\u201d based on user questions that are asked. Generally, IBM Watson Assistant needs five (5) or more user question examples to train on for a high confidence match to a user query. When user questions are cataloged by the system, NeuralSeek automatically tries to generate similar worded questions to meet the minimum of five (5) user examples. Similar Question generation may take up to one (1) minute to show inside the Curate tab after a new user question is logged. Why is it important? Users who develop and maintain Watson Assistant have to work with its Actions and Dialogs, and can quickly get overwhelmed by its vast numbers. Coming up with multiple number of questions for each intent is also very time consuming, but it also quickly becomes burdensome when you have to continuously monitor and update them by yourself. How does it work? NeuralSeek provides ways to generate the candiate questions and answers based on the contents inside the KnowledgeBase, and let users download the whole thing or portions of it, so that it could be created either as 1) Watson Assistant Actions, or 2) Watson Assistant Dialogs. Generating Questions and Answers After you have configured NeuralSeek, in its Home , you will see an option to auto-generate questions. Clicking will let NeuralSeek scan through your KnowledgeBase, and start generating potential questions that would be most commonly used. The resulting list of questions appear at the bottom. If you do not like the list of questions, you can re-generate them again, or edit them on the spot. When you feel like you can generate the Answers for those questions, you can click Submit button and those questions will be available on the curate tab of the top menu. Usually the most recently entered questions and answers appear at the top: Testing Questions During the curation process, usually the user would need to use Seek tab to submit questions to see how well the answer is generated. However, this process can be tedious if you have a certain set of questions that you want to ask in bulk and derive the results. In that case, you can use Upload Test Questions to upload multiple questions and generate their answers easily. Go to Home of NeuralSeek, and click Upload Test Questions . In the instructions, you will see a link of template file that you can download from. It's a template file in CSV format. click it to download. Use the file to enter the list of questions. For example, ID,Question 1,\"What are the main features of NeuralSeek?\" 2,\"What are the knowledgebases supported by NeuralSeek?\" 3,\"I want to integration NeuralSeek with Watson Assistant. What do I need to do?\" 4,\"Where can I see the demo?\" Click the upload button to upload the file. Click Submit button. NeuralSeek will run through the questions and let you know how many are being processed. When it is finsihed it When finished, you can either Download the report, Export All Q&A, or Delete the generated report. Download the report: it will give you a CSV file that has the following columns: ID,question,score,semanticScore,kbCoverage,totalCount,url,document,answer,categoryId,category,intent,pii,sentiment which will give you the answer and score of how well it got generated. Export All Q&A: it will export all the Q&A currently stored in NeuralSeek, in JSON format suitable to be imported as Watson Assistant Actions. Delete Report: it will delete the generated report, and will not be available anymore. Uploading Curated Q/A This feature is very similar to Upload Test Questions , but uses the CSV format that has ID,Question,Answer . User can create question and answer pairs to submit it, which will then be populated as edited answers in NeuralSeek. This feature is useful when you need to edit and upload answers in bulk fashion. An example format of the CSV is as follows: ID,Question,Answer 1,Tell me about NeralSeek,\"NeuralSeek is an AI-powered platform that generates natural-language answers to complex, open-ended, and contextual questions from real customers.\" Importing Q/A into Watson Assistant Depending on how your NeuralSeek is setup, it can either product questions and answers into Action type or Dialog type. That depends on whether your Watson Assistant is enabled with dialog or not. Importing into Watson Assistant as Actions \ud83d\udc49 As for importing Q&A into Watson Assistant, you can do it on both Watson Assistant Classic mode or new Dialog mode. Go to your Watson Assistant, and to go to Actions . Click the gear icon on top right to go into the settings. In the global settings, move to the right most tab which is Upload/Download , and click Download button to download the action's JSON file. A JSON file should be saved. Go to NeuralSeek, click Curate tab. Click Import Base Watson Assistant Actions . Upload the downloaded JSON file. Now, select one or more intents which you want to import into Watson Assistant. You will notice a new button is display which is Export to Watson Assistant Actions . It will download a JSON file called actions.json which will contain the selected intents that you want to convert it into Watson Assistant Actions. Go to Watson Assistant. At the same page where you just downloaded the JSON, click to select a file, and select the actions.json and click Upload button. You will see a warning message. Click Upload and replace . Now, close this page, and you will see the exported actions appear on your actions list. Click one of the actions. You should be able to see the list of the quesitons generated by NeuralSeek nicely populated. With these, you can easy save time to jump start Watson Assistant to provide better answers to the questions and answers generated by NeuralSeek. One other nice thing about this is that if you find any particular questions and answers that does not yet exist in Watson Assistant, you can easily move them from NeuralSeek. Importing into Watson Assistant as Dialogs Unlike importing them as Actions, you first need to export your Watson Assistant's dialogs and set them as Base Watson Assistant Dialog into NeuralSeek. That is because Watson Assistant, when uploading a Dialog, would simply override the existing dialog and upload a new one. In order to make sure any existing actions or dialogs are not deleted, NeuralSeek needs to have it first, and then merge the dialogs into it. Go to your Watson Assistant, and to go Dialog > Options > Upload / Download : Click Download tab and click Doanload button: A JSON file should be downloaded.

NeuralSeek will automatically generate IBM Watson Assistant \u201cActions\u201d or \u201cDialogs,\u201d based on user questions that are asked. Generally, IBM Watson Assistant needs five (5) or more user question examples to train on for a high confidence match to a user query. When user questions are cataloged by the system, NeuralSeek automatically tries to generate similar worded questions to meet the minimum of five (5) user examples. Similar Question generation may take up to one (1) minute to show inside the Curate tab after a new user question is logged. Why is it important? Users who develop and maintain Watson Assistant have to work with its Actions and Dialogs, and can quickly get overwhelmed by its vast numbers. Coming up with multiple number of questions for each intent is also very time consuming, but it also quickly becomes burdensome when you have to continuously monitor and update them by yourself. How does it work?

Use this guide to help get started, improve answers, and learn about some best practices. Bootstrapping your Agent NeuralSeek aims to make bulk-tuning easy, offering different methods for Subject-Matter Experts (SMEs) to collaborate and curate answers. To bootstrap your agent, you may find these options on the home screen. Auto-Generate Questions: This will run a query against your connected KnowledgeBase and attempt to generate a list of relevant questions to your subject matter, and then mimics the below option Manually Input Questions: Accepts a list of newline-separated questions, and will perform a Seek action with each question. This populates the Curate tab, while also generating a report spreadsheet that can be distributed among SMEs to weigh in on answers and make edits. (you can also export a similar spreadsheet from the Curate tab) Finally, you can upload the resulting edits via the \"Upload Curated Q&A\" option. Congratulations! You've quick-tuned your agent to your most important or relevant subjects. Improving Answers There are many ways to improve generated answers. This can include: Utilizing Semantic Scores to monitor or block low-quality answers Updating or improving documentation - Answers are only as good as the ground truth! Controlling the amount of information sent to the LLM and \"force\" answers from the KnowledgeBase Choosing Lucene VS Vector search (we also support a Hybrid mode!) Understanding Generated Answers A common issue with LLMs: giving answers that are irrelevant or inaccurate. NeuralSeek makes it easier to handle these cases. To reduce low quality answers, start on the Seek tab: Ask a question. To help analyze your answers, take a look at the following: Review the Semantic Score Is it low? (below 20%) - Perhaps your documentation does not compare well to the question posed, or there is many source jumps / unattributed terms Is it high? (above 60%) - If the answer is low quality - does your documentation have conflicting answers, or very similar terminology to the given query? Understand the Semantic Analysis text This is meant to offer insight into the scores given - e.g. a lot of terms from many documents, or primarily one source of documentation. Review the KB scores Low Coverage - There is not many documents matching the query High Coverage - There are many documents matching the query, or few documents that match exactly Low Confidence - The source KB thinks we do not have good matches to the query High Confidence - The source KB has found good query matches, but may not answer the query directly Review the documentation sources Expand the accordions below to see the actual source documentation provided by the KnowledgeBase. This is what is sent to the LLM for language generation. Improve the documentation: If the source documentation does not directly answer the question, updating the source content will almost always help. Adjust the Document Score Range: This widens, or shrinks, the top % of documents that will be considered. Adjust the Snippet Size: This can help narrow passages out of blocks of unrelated text, or widen the scope for large paragraphs that only mention the subject of your query once. Narrow the Max Documents per Seek: This can help target only the best scoring/matching documents, and avoid confusing some LLMs with a slew of information. To give some examples: Here, we've set the maximum allowed documents to one with snippet size set to 2000 (the largest): Some things to notice: There is only one document result The semantic score is high If you expand the document accordion - there is a lot of text returned in this passage In the next example, we've set the maximum allowed documents to three with snippet size set to 400 (relatively small): We now have: One additional document (total of 2) A lower semantic score More source jumps in the answer Generally speaking, and for most use cases, it is better to provide a few top quality documents, versus many low quality or unrelated documents, to the LLM for answer generation. Using these settings can help focus or widen the documentation as needed per use-case. Optimal Settings For most use-cases, the combination of settings that we get the best results with are close to: In KB Tuning: Document Score Range: 0.6 - 0.8 Max Documents per Seek: 4 - 5 Snippet Size: If your documents are mostly filled with unrelated small paragraphs (2-3 sentences) - like an faq document - then 400 - 600 is appropriate. Note it is always best to break up documents containing unrelated information into multiple documents. If your documents are large reference manuals that contain long passages - use the max snippet size available to you. In Answer Engineering: Answer Verbosity slider favoring the \"Very Concise\" side Enable Force Answers from the KnowledgeBase In Governance and Guardrails: Warning Confidence around +/- 20% Minimum Confidence around +/- 10-20% Minimum Text around 1-3 words Maximum Length around 20 words Improving Source Documentation One of the best ways to directly improve answer generation! Here's an example: A customer had a very large document, with an Acronym and a definition that was near the top of the document. The acronym was used hundreds of times across many pages. The source KB typically returned the paragraph with the most uses (matches) of the acronym, despite the overall snippet not answering the question directly. To improve the results, we split the document by pages, increased the score range and lowered the snippet size, allowing the KB to effortlessly bring back the relevant document passages while enabling the customer to control the amount of documentation fed to the LLM. Generally speaking, the best practice for source documentation formatting is to have individual documents that speak directly to the subject you want to answer . Hybrid and Vector Search NeuralSeek supports Vector searching on some KnowledgeBase platforms. (see the Supported KnowledgeBases page for details) Vector Similarity searching is finding \"similar\" words, where Lucene is \"exact matching\" terms. For example, if you search for Animal you could also get results like Cat, Dog, Mouse, Lizard . It's not recommended to use only vector search for corporate-based RAG, as the chance of hallucination is incredibly high. For example - a user searches for 8.1.0 . Lucene will bring back only results with the exact term, where vector similarity may also return 8.0.1 , 8.10 , or similar. Choosing the Hybrid implementation is recommended if using vector similarity - NeuralSeek will boost the Lucene results, offering Vector results as a sort of \"fallback\". This can help some use cases. Pure vector serach is not reccomended in any RAG pattern as any vector search increases the likelihood of halucinations. Answer Variations Generative AI often times will generate small variations for the same query. Two ways to combat this: Set the \"edited\" answer cache setting to 1, and edit the answer on the curate tab. Set the \"normal\" answer cache setting to 1. Both of these options will cause NeuralSeek to output consistent, identical answers. This also reduces the amount of language generation calls. Note Edited answers always return a Semantic Score of 100%. Filtering Documentation Many times there is a large amount of documents, or many data sources / types, to manage. Filtering can narrow down results in a large pool of data. You may filter on any metadata field available from the KB. Simply set the desired field in the KnowledgeBase Connection settings, and pass a value for which to filter in the Seek call. For example - Using metadata.document_type as the field, and PDF as the value, will return only documents with this field set to PDF. Use comma-separated values for an OR filter. Watson Discovery users To filter by Collection ID: Under KnowledgeBase Connection, enable the Advanced Schema, and manually input collection_id in the filter field DQL_Pushdown is also an option for Discovery users - Select this option, and pass DQL syntax in the filter value on Seek calls. Another tool to help target the best quality documentation available is to utilize the \"Re-Sort values list\" option. This allows you to prioritize certain documents over others - maybe use a collection ID to prioritize internal uploaded documentation over a general company website scrape, or perhaps PDFs have more concise data than your DOCX files. This allows you to prioritize values without entirely excluding other values. Avoiding Timeouts NeuralSeek has a limited amount of time to generate a response, as well as a context window that the LLM dictates. Sometimes, the LLM generates large answers and cannot finish its thought before the space runs out, we exceed the chatbot platform timeout, or we exceed the KB's timeout. This will occasionally cause the generated answer to have a dangling sentence near the end - NeuralSeek looks for these dangling responses and trims them back to a logical sentence. Contributing factors can include: KnowledgeBase retrieval speed LLM generation speed Chatbot settings - timeout settings, etc Network latency Some settings that may help: Reducing the maximum number of documents returned from the KB Using a faster LLM Reducing LLM verbosity in the NeuralSeek Configuration Increasing the chatbot timeout threshold Provisioning services in the same regions Note When adjusting the verbosity setting, for shorter answers change the verbosity setting to \"more concise\". For longer/more descriptive answers change the verbosity setting to \"more verbose\". KnowledgeBase Translation It can be challenging to work with multiple languages. For example - you want the LLM to respond in Spanish, but the source documentation is in English. NeuralSeek can solve this: In the Platform Preferences configuration, enable Translate into KB Language , and set the desired output language. This allows NeuralSeek to: Accept a question in Spanish (for example) Translate to English (source documentation language) Perform a KB search in English Generate an Answer in English Translate the Answer to Spanish For Bring-your-own LLM users When using the cross-language feature of NeuralSeek, some LLMs will not excel at this. You will need to use a powerful model like GPT, Llama 70b, or Mixtral. You can set NeuralSeek's output language to \"Match Input\" to respond in the same language as the query. Another choice is to have the chatbot control the language returned. Some chatbots support passing the language dynamically as a context variable to the NeuralSeek API. The source of the context variable can be the web browser language or part of the chatbot's URL that tells you the user's language. Example from watsonx Assistant: Using Multiple Data Sources NeuralSeek allows you to use multiple configurations on-demand, effectively overriding any settings currently in the Configure tab. This is useful if you want to use multiple KB sources, project IDs, or similarly exceed the UI limitations. Simply configure NeuralSeek with the desired parameters, save, and then \"Download Settings\" as pictured. This will download a .dat file, containing an encoded string of all current settings - including KB details, project IDs, LLMs, etc. On Seek API calls, set options.override to this encoded string - Effectively using these saved settings for this Seek call, ignoring \"current\" settings in the UI.","title":"KnowledgeBase Tuning"},{"location":"reference_material/guides/tuning_guide/tuning_guide/#overview","text":"This guide provides information on improving answers from the connected KnowledgeBase - Your ground truth .

For example, if you search for Animal you could also get results like Cat, Dog, Mouse, Lizard . It's not recommended to use only vector search for corporate-based RAG, as the chance of hallucination is incredibly high. For example - a user searches for 8.1.0 . Lucene will bring back only results with the exact term, where vector similarity may also return 8.0.1 , 8.10 , or similar. Choosing the Hybrid implementation is recommended if using vector similarity - NeuralSeek will boost the Lucene results, offering Vector results as a sort of \"fallback\". This can help some use cases. Pure vector serach is not reccomended in any RAG pattern as any vector search increases the likelihood of halucinations.","title":"Hybrid and Vector Search"},{"location":"reference_material/guides/tuning_guide/tuning_guide/#answer-variations","text":"Generative AI often times will generate small variations for the same query.

Filtering can narrow down results in a large pool of data. You may filter on any metadata field available from the KB. Simply set the desired field in the KnowledgeBase Connection settings, and pass a value for which to filter in the Seek call. For example - Using metadata.document_type as the field, and PDF as the value, will return only documents with this field set to PDF. Use comma-separated values for an OR filter. Watson Discovery users To filter by Collection ID: Under KnowledgeBase Connection, enable the Advanced Schema, and manually input collection_id in the filter field DQL_Pushdown is also an option for Discovery users - Select this option, and pass DQL syntax in the filter value on Seek calls. Another tool to help target the best quality documentation available is to utilize the \"Re-Sort values list\" option. This allows you to prioritize certain documents over others - maybe use a collection ID to prioritize internal uploaded documentation over a general company website scrape, or perhaps PDFs have more concise data than your DOCX files. This allows you to prioritize values without entirely excluding other values.","title":"Filtering Documentation"},{"location":"reference_material/guides/tuning_guide/tuning_guide/#avoiding-timeouts","text":"NeuralSeek has a limited amount of time to generate a response, as well as a context window that the LLM dictates.

You will need to use a powerful model like GPT, Llama 70b, or Mixtral. You can set NeuralSeek's output language to \"Match Input\" to respond in the same language as the query. Another choice is to have the chatbot control the language returned. Some chatbots support passing the language dynamically as a context variable to the NeuralSeek API.

Expand steps individually to drill down into specific values, calculations, assignments, or generation. Quick start with auto-builder Get started by giving a prompt in the auto-builder. Use this example prompt: Build a template to send individualized emails to each address listed in an input CSV file . This gives you the ability to start from scratch, use an existing template or build one using natural language commands. This will output a customizable template that you can test or adapt to your needs. Understanding the Visual Editor Click to insert All the elements on the left panel can be created in the editor by clicking them. Click to edit Selecting a card will highlight the node blue, and a dialog will appear on the right side to edit the configuration options for the selected node. Depending on the type of the node, there may be several options. See the NTL reference page for a description of all configurable options. Deleting a node You may delete a node by clicking the red Delete Node button at the bottom of the options panel. Hover Menus Hovering allows users to easily access and insert secrets, user-defined variables, system-defined variables, or generate new variables while working in the visual builder. This feature enhances the building process by providing quick access to essential elements without disrupting the workflow. Stacking elements Adding nodes, by default, will connect the elements vertically. We call this Stacking , or building a Flow . Stacked elements flow from top to bottom, meaning the output produced by the top element will become available as input to the bottom/next element. Chaining elements You can also connect elements horizontally. This is called Chaining . Chaining is useful when you want to direct a node's output. In this example, the output of the LLM will be provided as input to the extract keywords element - chained together. Example: Click the element Extract Keywords to get stacked under Send To LLM . Select the node, and drag it the right side of the element that you want to chain. You will see a blue dot indicating the chained connection. Release the selection, chaining the nodes together. Evaluating Clicking the evaluate button will run the expression, and generate output. Saving as user template You may frequently use the same expression over and over again. We offer the ability to save the template for re-use, and also be triggered via an API call. Build an expression, and then click the Save button along the bottom of the editor. Enter the template name and (optional) description. Click Save in the dialog to save it as a user template. Loading the template Your saved template can be loaded into the editor, or called upon later from the API. Click the Load button along the bottom of the editor, select User Templates , and click the checkbox to the template that you want to load. Click Load Template to load the saved template into the editor. Output Formats Inline - Suitable for displaying rendered output from the flow, supporting charts and HTML. Example: Display a chart using data retrieved from an API endpoint, rendered with Chart.js. Preview the HTML generated by the LLM node. Raw - Useful for viewing the unprocessed text output from the flow. Example: Validate raw HTML generated from a HTTP request to a user endpoint, creating a presentation HTML user card.

Set Variable Creates or sets a variable that can be used later in the NTL expression. For example, 34=>{{ variable | name:\"age\" }} or {{ variable | name: \"age\" | value: \"34\" }} Parameters: Name: The name of the variable to set.

Condition The Conditional function allows us to direct the flow of operations. {{ condition | value: \"1 == 1\" }} Parameters: Value: The conditional / logic to evaluate. Supports the following: Common comparison operators like == , != , > , < , >= , <= , <> . Common mathematical operators like + , - , / , * wrapped within parenthesis () . Logical functions: IF: Ternary operator: IF(condition or function, truevalue, falsevalue) NOT: Inverse operator: NOT(condition) AND: Logical and: AND(condition, condition) - Accepts 2 or more conditions OR: Logical or: OR(condition, condition) - Accepts 2 or more conditions String comparisons: Using single-quoted strings, you can use equality conditions == and != . CONTAINS: You can check for substrings: CONTAINS('long string to check', 'string') LENGTH: You can evaluate the length of a string to use in conditions: LENGTH('string') (this example evaluates to 6) Variables must be wrapped in single quotes for comparison or substring check. Returns: No returns, however: A condition that evaluates to 'true' will continue the horizontal chain. A condition that evaluates to 'false' will stop the horizontal chain from executing and continue to the next flow step.

Variable: The name of the variable to assign the resulting JSON. Returns: Nothing - Output is assigned to the set variable name. Example 1: Howard has 20 cats and 40 dogs. He took them to the vet last week.=>{{ grammar }}=>{{ variable | name: \"text\" }} {{ varsToJSON | path: \"\" | variable: \"gm\" }} << name: gm, prompt: false >> Will yield: { \"grammar\": { \"year\": [ 2024 ], \"context\": \"\", \"dates\": [ \"last\", \"week\" ], \"propernouns\": [ \"Howard\" ], \"nouns\": [ \"20 cats\", \"40 dogs\", \"vet\", \"week\" ], \"preps\": [ \"He\", \"them\" ], \"determiners\": [] }, \"text\": \"Howard has 20 cats and 40 dogs. \\nHe took them to the vet last week.\" } Example 2: Using the path parameter, we can specify the starting path of values we want: Howard has 20 cats and 40 dogs. He took them to the vet last week.=>{{ grammar }}=>{{ variable | name: \"text\" }} {{ varsToJSON | path: \"grammar.dates\" | variable: \"gm\" }} << name: gm, prompt: false >> Will yield: { \"grammar\": { \"dates\": [ \"last\", \"week\" ] } } Summarize Summarizes input text while preserving the main subject of the content. {{ summarize|length:100|match:\"\" }} Parameters: Length: The total maximum character length of the output/summary. Match: The text around which to prioritize the summary. Returns: The resulting summary. Example 1: I have 20 cats and 40 dogs - it's a lot of furry friends to take care of! My name is Jane and I run an animal rescue shelter out of my home. It all started a few years ago when I took in a litter of abandoned kittens. I fell in love with them and decided to make it my mission to give unwanted animals a forever home. {{ summarize|length:100 }} Yields: I have 20 cats and 40 dogs - it's a lot of furry friends to take care of! Example 2: Using match I have 20 cats and 40 dogs - it's a lot of furry friends to take care of! My name is Jane and I run an animal rescue shelter out of my home. It all started a few years ago when I took in a litter of abandoned kittens. I fell in love with them and decided to make it my mission to give unwanted animals a forever home. {{ summarize|length:100|match:\"love\" }} Yields: I fell in love with them and decided to make it my mission to give unwanted animals a forever home. Truncate by Tokens Helpful to manage the size of context sent to the LLM, this allows you to truncate to a specific number of tokens effortlessly. {{ truncateToken | tokens: \"\" }} Parameters: Tokens: The maximum number of tokens to allow in the returned text. Returns: The resulting text clipped to the specified amount of tokens. Example 1: {{ kb | query: \"NeuralSeek\" }}=>{{ truncateToken | tokens: \"2000\" }}=>{{ variable | name: \"documentation\" }} Would yield a variable far too large to include here, but would limit the resulting documentation text to 2000 (2k) tokens before assigning to the documentation variable. This helps prevent exceeding context windows of some smaller LLMs. Remove Stopwords Removes stop words from input text. {{ stopwords }} Parameters: None - Data should be \"chained\" into this function. Returns: The resulting text with stopwords removed. Example: I have 20 cats and 40 dogs, isn't this amazing? {{ stopwords }} Will yield 20 cats 40 dogs, amazing? Notice the words I, have, and, isn't, this are deemed as stopwords and thus have been removed. Force Numeric This function removes all non-numeric characters, and string-style concatenates the remainder into a single value. {{ forceNumeric }} Parameters: None - Data should be \"chained\" into this function. Returns: The resulting number. Example: I have 20 cats and 40 dogs contains numeric values. So, running this: I have 20 cats and 40 dogs {{ forceNumeric }} Will yield: 2040 Table Prep This function prepares tabular data to be better understood and processed by LLM. {{ tablePrep | query:\"\" | sentences: \"true\" }} Parameters: Query: Keywords to help narrow the returned data. Sentences: If true, return the output in natural language expressions. If false, return JSON format. Returns: The resulting natural language text or JSON. Example 1: If we have CSV data, table prep will convert it to JSON or natural language: col1,col2,col3 data1,data2,data3 data11,data22,data33 {{ tablePrep | sentences: \"false\" }} The result will be: { \"col1\": [ \"data1\", \"data11\" ], \"col2\": [ \"data2\", \"data22\" ], \"col3\": [ \"data3\", \"data33\" ] } Example 2: Using the query parameter: col1,col2,col3 data1,data2,data3 data11,data22,data33 {{ tablePrep|query: \"values for col1\" }} Will yield all the values for col1: { \"col1\": [ \"data1\", \"data11\" ] } Example 3: Using the sentences: true parameter: col1,col2,col3 data1,data2,data3 data11,data22,data33 {{ tablePrep | sentences: \"true\" }} Will yield: Record number 0 lists that col1 is data1, and the col2 is data2, and the col3 is data3. Record number 1 lists that col1 is data11, and the col2 is data22, and the col3 is data33. Split Simple split operation to split (or cut) part of text using start and end string. Alternatively used to remove page headers/footers. Helpful when processing web content/text. {{ split | start: \"\" | end: \"\" | removeHeaders: true }} Parameters: Start: Match string to begin the split. Included in the result. Case-sensitive. End: The match string to end the split. Excluded from the result. Case-sensitive. Remove Headers: If true, remove repeating lines of text (e.g. headers or footers). If false, do not remove repeating text. Returns: The resulting split chunk of text. Example 1: I have 20 cats and 40 dogs. {{ split | start: \"20\" | end: \"40\" | removeHeaders: false }} will yield: 20 cats and Example 2: Using removeHeaders will strip frequently repeating lines out of given input text: My animals: I have 20 cats and 40 dogs. My animals: I have 47 hamsters and 22 pet snakes. My animals: I pet all my animals every day. {{ split | removeHeaders: true }} Would yield: I have 20 cats and 40 dogs. I have 47 hamsters and 22 pet snakes. I pet all my animals every day. Regular Expression Performs regular expression on input data. Regular expression can be a powerful feature to extract or replace certain data. {{ regex | match: \"\" | replace: \"\" | group: \"\" }} Parameters: Match: The match regex to use. E.g. /[^0-9A-Za-z\\s]/g Replace: The string to substitute for matches. Group: Returns: The replaced text, or in case of using the group parameter, the group match. Example 1: If you have a text that you need to replace with something else, you can use the following expression: my name is howardyoo {{ regex | match: \"yoo\" | replace: \"yu\" }} Which yields: my name is howardyu Example 2: Regex also supports extraction. For example, if you want to extract the email address in a text message, you can do so: my name is howardyoo@email.com {{ regex | match: \"[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}\" | group: \"0\" }} This will extract the email address (group 0). The result is: howardyoo@email.com Example 3: Regex also supports groups, so in case you want to get the last digits of a phone number, you can do so: my phone number is 213-292-3322 {{ regex | match: \"([0-9]+)-([0-9]+)-([0-9]+)\" | group: \"3\" }} which will result in: 3322","title":"Modify data"},{"location":"reference_material/maistro/ntl/modify_data/#json-tools","text":"Cleanse and filter JSON for later use. {{ jsonTools | filter: \"value\" | filterType: \"\" }} Parameters: Filter: A value for which we should filter items.
