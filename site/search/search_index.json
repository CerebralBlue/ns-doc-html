NeuralSeek features an advanced Personal Identifiable Information (PII) detection routine that automatically identifies any PII within user inputs. It allows users to flag, mask, hide, or delete the detected PII. Why is it important? Users can maintain a secure environment while providing accurate responses to user queries, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations and protecting sensitive information. How does it work? Common and well known PII detection is enabled by default in NeuralSeek. When you enter a PII information, for example, when you enter a credit card number in Seek: In NeuralSeek, the question above will be logged and flagged as containing PII information and warns user about a potential risk. The credit card number is also masked and removed, so that the data is protected from being viewed. The answers to these questions also indicate that they were generated from a question with PII in it, so that you can easily identify them. Defining a specific PII However, this is what NeuralSeek does against common PII patterns, and there may be a specific PII that you would like to hide for your specific business needs. If you want to help NeuralSeek better detect and process PII for that, you can configure it under Configure > Personal Identifiable Information (PII) Handling in the top menu: How it works is based on an example sentence, and does not have to be an exact pattern or rules. For example, setting the example sentence as: My name is Howard Yoo and my blood type is O, and I live in Chicago. For each PII element in that sentence, you can define the PII elements in that sentence delimited by comma as such: Howard Yoo, 0 So, next time, when somebody enters a PII matching the example as such: This is my blood type: A NeuralSeek now detects that and masks the blood type that the user provided from being exposed: Ignoring certain PII You can also make NeuralSeek ignore certain PII by entering \u201cNo PII\u201d to the element. For example, by setting the element as \u201cNo PII\u201d with a given example sentence, NeuralSeek will not filter out the question even though it would contain an PII element: Therefore, when asked about a similar question, notice how dog\u2019s name is now visible as not a PII information: The base reason to use this is that sometimes, NeuralSeek would mistake certain questions to be containing PII, even though the sentence may clearly not contain any such data. In that case, setting what not to consider as PII would be very helpful. Round Trip Logging What is it? Round-trip logging is a process that involves recording and storing all interactions between a user and a Virtual Agent. NeuralSeek supports receiving logs from Virtual Agents in order to monitor curated responses. This includes the user\u2019s question, the Virtual Agent\u2019s response, and any follow-up questions or clarifications. Why is it important? The purpose of round-trip logging is to improve the Virtual Agent\u2019s performance by alerting to content in the Virtual Agent that is likely out of date, because the source documentation has changed. How does it work? The Source Virtual Agent is connected to NeuralSeek via the specific instructions per platform on the Integrate tab. Once connected, NeuralSeek will monitor for intents that are being used live in the Virtual Agent. Once per day NeuralSeek will search the connected KnowledgeBase and recompute the hash for the returned data. That hash will be compared to the hash of the answers stored, and if no match is found, an alert will be generated notifying that the source documentation has changed compared to the last Answer generation completed by the seek endpoint. Semantic Analytics What is it? NeuralSeek generates responses by directly utilizing content from corporate sources. In order to ensure transparency between the sources and answers, NeuralSeek reveals the specific origin of the words and phrases that are generated. Clarity is further achieved by employing semantic match scores. These scores compare the generated response with the ground truth documentation, providing a clear understanding of the alignment between the response and the meaning conveyed in source documents. This ensures accuracy and instills confidence in the reliability of the responses generated by NeuralSeek. Why is it important? By being able to analyze how the answer generated would be originated from the actual facts given by the KnowledgeBase, users can analyze from which sources the responses actually originated from, and how much of the responses are directly coming from the knowledge versus how much of them are from LLM\u2019s generated answer. This ensures accuracy and instills confidence in the reliability of the responses generated by NeuralSeek. For example, NeuralSeek\u2019s Seek will provide rich semantic analytics in terms of how well the response cover for the facts found in the KnowledgeBase (or cached generated answers) by color-coding the area of it in the response, visually linking it to the sources, and providing semantic analysis result to explain the key reasons behind the semantic match score given. How does it work? When NeuralSeek receives a question, it will first try to match for existing intents and answers, it will also try to search the underlying corporate KnowledgeBase and return any relevant passages from a number of sources. NeuralSeek will then either use these answers as-is directly, or use parts of the information to form a response using LLM\u2019s generative AI capability. Configuring Semantic Analytics Configuration option for Semantic analysis is found under Configure > Confidence & Warning Thresholds . The semantic score model is enabled by default, but you can also disable it. You can also enable whether the semantic analysis should be used for confidence, and for reranking the search results from the knowledge base according to how much they semantically match. There are also sections for controlling how the analysis can apply penalties for missing key terms, search terms, or how frequent the sources are jumped (fragmented in the generated answer). \u2753 How re-ranking the search result using semantic analysis can be helpful? Having an option to re-rank the resulting KnowledgeBase search results can ensure the list of search results to appear in the order that corresponds better to the answer provided. That is because sometimes the search results returned from the KnowledgeBase do not align perfectly with the answer, and thus the provided URL of the resulting document can be misleading. Using Semantic Analysis In the \u2018Seek\u2019 tab of NeuralSeek, you can provide a question, and be given an answer from NeuralSeek. When enabling the \u2018Provenance\u2019, this will give you the color-coded portion of the response that were directly originated from those results. Below the answer, you will see some of the key insights related to the answer, such as Semantic Match score (in %) , Semantic Analysis , as well as results coming from KnowledgeBase in terms of KB Confidence , KB Coverage , KB Response Time , and KB Results . Semantic Match % is the overall match \u2018score\u2019 that indicates how much NeuralSeek believes that the responses are well aligned with the underlying ground truth (from KnowledgeBase). The higher the % is, the more accurate and relevant the answer is based on the truth. Semantic Analysis explains why NeuralSeek calculated the matching score given in a way that is easy for users to understand. By reading this summary, users are given a good understanding why the answer was given either a high or low score. Knowledge confidence, coverage, response time, and results are all coming from the KnowledgeBase itself. These percentages indicate the level of confidence and coverage, signifying the extent to which the KnowledgeBase believes the retrieved sources are relevant to the provided question. KnowledgeBase contexts are the \u2018snippets\u2019 of sources from the KnowledgeBase, based on the relevance of what it found within its data. Clicking one of them would reveal the found passage, and the color code matching that of the generated answer would be used to highlight the parts that were used. Lastly, the stump speech that is defined in NeuralSeek\u2019s configuration is shown and color-coded based on how much of it was used in the answer. If you are wondering where the Stump Speech is stored, you can find it in Configure > Company / Organization Preferences section: Setting the Date Penalty or Score Range The resulting KnowledgeBase result does get affected by the configuration that you set for the corporate KnowledgeBase you are using with NeuralSeek. You can find these settings in Configure > Corporate KnowledgeBase Details section: Document score range dictates the range of possible \u2018relevance scores\u2019 that it will return as the result. For example, if the score range is 80%, the results will be of relevance score higher than 20% and equal or lower than 100%. If the score range is 20%, the relevancy score range would then be anything between 80% ~ 100%, respectively. Document Date Penalty, if specified higher than 0%, will start to impose penalty scores to reduce the relevancy based on how old the information is coming from. KnowledgeBase will try to find any time related information in the document and would reduce the score based on how old the time is, relative to current time. When the results say, '4 filtered by date penalty or score range', it means these settings came into play when retrieving relevant information from the KnowledgeBase. Examples of Semantic Analysis High score example Medium score example Low score example Sentiment Analysis What is it? NeuralSeek's sentiment analysis is a feature that allows users to analyze the sentiment or emotional tone of a piece of text. It can determine whether the sentiment expressed in the text is positive, negative, or neutral. NeuralSeek's sentiment analysis is based on advanced natural language processing techniques and can provide valuable insights for businesses and organizations. Why is it important? By being able to detect whether a user is negative or positive about certain questions, you can let the virtual agent use this information to provide more tailored services. For example, for a user who expresses negative sentiment, virtual agents might forward the session to human agents or assign higher priority so that more attention could be provided. How does it work? NeuralSeek will run sentiment analysis on the user\u2019s input text. Sentiment is returned as an integer between zero (0) and nine (9), with zero (0) being the most negative, nine (9) being the most positive, and five (5) being neutral. Sentiment Analysis REST API When using REST API, for example, providing negative comments could trigger a low sentiment analysis score. { \"question\" : \"I don't like NeuralSeek\" , \"context\" : {}, \"user_session\" : { \"metadata\" : { \"user_id\" : \"string\" }, \"system\" : { \"session_id\" : \"string\" } }, Would yield a response with low sentiment score: { \"answer\" : \"String i'm sorry to hear that you don't like NeuralSeek. If you have any specific concerns or feedback, please let me know and I'll do my best to assist you.\" , \"cachedResult\" : false , \"langCode\" : \"string\" , \"sentiment\" : 3 , \"totalCount\" : 9 , \"KBscore\" : 3 , \"score\" : 3 , \"url\" : \"https://neuralseek.com/faq\" , \"document\" : \"FAQ - NeuralSeek\" , \"kbTime\" : 454 , \"kbCoverage\" : 24 , \"time\" : 2688 } Notice the sentiment score of 3, which is in the low range of 0 - 10. On the other hand, if you express a positive sentiment as such: { \"question\" : \"I really love NeuralSeek. It's the best software in the world.\" , \"context\" : {}, \"user_session\" : { \"metadata\" : { \"user_id\" : \"string\" }, \"system\" : { \"session_id\" : \"string\" } }, The response will have a higher sentiment score: { \"answer\" : \"Thank you for sharing your positive feedback about NeuralSeek. I cannot have personal opinions, but I'm glad to hear that you find NeuralSeek to be the best software in the world.\" , \"cachedResult\" : false , \"langCode\" : \"string\" , \"sentiment\" : 9 , \"totalCount\" : 9 , \"KBscore\" : 15 , \"score\" : 15 , \"url\" : \"https://neuralseek.com/faq\" , \"document\" : \"FAQ - NeuralSeek\" , \"kbTime\" : 5385 , \"kbCoverage\" : 8 , \"time\" : 7094 } Table Understanding What is it? Table Extraction, also known as Table understanding , pre-processes your documents to extract and parse table data into a format suitable for conversational queries. Since this preparation process is both costly and time-consuming , this feature is opt-in and will consume 1 seek query for every table preprocessed. Also, it should be noted that Web Crawl Collections are not eligible for table understanding, as the recrawl interval will cause excessive computing usage. Table preparation time takes several minutes per page. Why is it important? Being able to understand data in tabular structure in documents and generating answers is an important capability for NeuralSeek in order to better find the relevant data for answering. How does it work? To find table extraction, open up your instance of NeuralSeek and head over to the Configure . Select Table understanding \u26a0\ufe0f Note for users of lite/trial plans - to be able to access and use this feature you will have to contact cloud@cerebralblue.com with details of your opportunity and use case to be eligible. Once you have everything set, go over to Watson Discovery , and if you don\u2019t already, create a project and import a pdf file that contains some tables. Once you have the project copy the API information and go back to the Configure in NeuralSeek. Scroll down to Table Understanding, paste the project id, hit save, and proceed to the Seek tab. With everything set, ask some questions related to the data inside the table in the PDF file. What were the GHG emissions for business travel in 2021?

Round-trip logging is a process that involves recording and storing all interactions between a user and a Virtual Agent. NeuralSeek supports receiving logs from Virtual Agents in order to monitor curated responses. This includes the user\u2019s question, the Virtual Agent\u2019s response, and any follow-up questions or clarifications. Why is it important? The purpose of round-trip logging is to improve the Virtual Agent\u2019s performance by alerting to content in the Virtual Agent that is likely out of date, because the source documentation has changed. How does it work? The Source Virtual Agent is connected to NeuralSeek via the specific instructions per platform on the Integrate tab. Once connected, NeuralSeek will monitor for intents that are being used live in the Virtual Agent. Once per day NeuralSeek will search the connected KnowledgeBase and recompute the hash for the returned data. That hash will be compared to the hash of the answers stored, and if no match is found, an alert will be generated notifying that the source documentation has changed compared to the last Answer generation completed by the seek endpoint.","title":"Round Trip Logging"},{"location":"main_features/advanced_features/advanced_features/#semantic-analytics","text":"What is it? NeuralSeek generates responses by directly utilizing content from corporate sources. In order to ensure transparency between the sources and answers, NeuralSeek reveals the specific origin of the words and phrases that are generated.

These scores compare the generated response with the ground truth documentation, providing a clear understanding of the alignment between the response and the meaning conveyed in source documents. This ensures accuracy and instills confidence in the reliability of the responses generated by NeuralSeek. Why is it important? By being able to analyze how the answer generated would be originated from the actual facts given by the KnowledgeBase, users can analyze from which sources the responses actually originated from, and how much of the responses are directly coming from the knowledge versus how much of them are from LLM\u2019s generated answer. This ensures accuracy and instills confidence in the reliability of the responses generated by NeuralSeek. For example, NeuralSeek\u2019s Seek will provide rich semantic analytics in terms of how well the response cover for the facts found in the KnowledgeBase (or cached generated answers) by color-coding the area of it in the response, visually linking it to the sources, and providing semantic analysis result to explain the key reasons behind the semantic match score given. How does it work? When NeuralSeek receives a question, it will first try to match for existing intents and answers, it will also try to search the underlying corporate KnowledgeBase and return any relevant passages from a number of sources.

By being able to detect whether a user is negative or positive about certain questions, you can let the virtual agent use this information to provide more tailored services. For example, for a user who expresses negative sentiment, virtual agents might forward the session to human agents or assign higher priority so that more attention could be provided. How does it work? NeuralSeek will run sentiment analysis on the user\u2019s input text.

NeuralSeek maintains context during each user interaction (conversation). When initiating a conversation, a session token is generated. Using this token and several Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, NeuralSeek tracks the topic of conversation to keep interactions focused and structured, allowing it to follow-up on questions that do not directly refer to the topic. In addition, these NLP models enable NeuralSeek to filter corporate knowledge topically by date to ensure that the information being returned is focused on the time period of the question. Why is it important? Conversational Context allows for NeuralSeek to answer questions without users being specific about their language for every turn of the conversation. This enables higher containment rates in customer-facing conversations. How does it work? NeuralSeek employs several NLP models to identify and extract meaning, intent, and main subject from user questions and generated responses. These then inform later turns of the conversation so that the proper context can be brought forward from the KnowledgeBase and used for answer formation. It also weighs heavily on caching and how the data can be cached. For example - The answer to a user question like \"how does it work\" depends heavily on the previous statements from a user. NeuralSeek requires that you pass an ID that can uniquely identify a user's session to enable this conversational context. The can be either or both the user_id and the session_id properties on the seek request. You do not need to maintain consistent id's over time for a specific actual person - the id must just be constant for the session that you wish to maintain context for. Curation of Answers What is it? NeuralSeek is directly trained off of the documentation loaded into the KnowledgeBase. If there are undesired answers from NeuralSeek, the first step is to review the documentation within the KnowledgeBase, and effectively curate the answer which can then be used by NeuralSeek to train itself better the next time it answers. Why is it important? One of the key factors in reducing costs is the utilization of curated answers sourced from a pool of responses, which proves to be more economical. Also, when the collection of answers becomes stagnant, potentially leading to outdated information, this feature will be able to detect it and refresh those with less manual process. How does it work? To tackle this challenge, NeuralSeek provides a solution by automatically monitoring the sources of information. It continuously tracks and compares the generated responses with the source documents to determine if any changes have occurred. By doing so, NeuralSeek ensures that the answers remain up-to-date and relevant. This eliminates the need for manual intervention and the potential for outdated information, allowing users to trust the accuracy and currency of the answers provided. Curating Intents and Answers Let's first visit the UI page for curating intents and answers. Click the Curate tab on the top menu. The UI is composed of the following columns: Intent : Intents are a collection of questions that may be related to the similar intent of the question. It is prefixed by certain types of intents, such as FAQ , followed by the question's subject areas. By default, all the intents do fall under a category Others , but you can also define your own category in NeuralSeek's configuration. Intents also have a number of indicators that help users to understand the status of the intent. For example, it can show whether the intent has any new answers, whether the intent contains any PII (personally identifiable information), or whether the intent's underlying data has been outdated, etc. Q&A : Shows the number of questions (white dialog icon) and answers (blue dialog icon) that this particular intent contains. Coverage % : Indicates how much the KnowledgeBase has contributed to the answer's coverage. If NeuralSeek was able to find all the necessary information from the KnowledgeBase, this percentage is going to be very high. Confidence % : Indicates how much NeuralSeek's answer is most likely to satisfy the user. If this score is high, it means the answer has a high score of being legitimate and true to the facts. Reading the trend Each of the graphs (coverage and confidence) has color codes that lets users visibly understand the state and trend. Coverage uses blue color with intensity that changes as its coverage is low or high. Confidence shows green to display high confidence to red meaning low confidence. You may also notice the slope has different heights, which gets smaller as there are more changes on its value. Hovering over the graph would reveal the trend of changes: In this case, there were instances of when the confidence had dropped from 83% to 22%, over the period between 14:07:31 to 14:12:15 on July 20th. Displaying Intents and Answers If you click the \u2304 Arrow next to the intent name, you will see the list of example questions and its generated answers: The example questions have either black color or gray color, depending on how they were created. The black colored examples are the ones that were actually submitted by the user's question. NeuralSeek automatically generates similar meaning questions per each question that it receives. As necessary, you can also enter your own Example question in addition to the ones that NeuralSeek generates. It is also possible to add Notes that may save additional information regarding this particular intent. Searching the intent The size of intent can vary but could grow over multiple pages, so you may want to search for a particular intent from time to time. You could do that by using the search form at the top of the page. Enter the keyword and it will narrow down your search. Filtering the intent There is a more fine-grained way of filtering intents based on criteria such as whether they were edited, or a new answer was added, flagged, or out-of-date data was found. Click the filter button, set the criterias that you want, and the page will only show the ones that meet the filtering condition. Editing the Answer On all the answers generated, you can curate any answer by editing it. One of the reasons why you may need to edit it is because the generated answer could be better by editing, or you could add more details to it that were originally missing. Edited answers will be saved and will be considered higher priority over non-edited answers, to ensure that what you edited will be picked out first. Editing can be done by clicking the answer, modifying its content, and saving it. After saving, you will see that the answer that you edited will be marked as Edited . Deleting Questions and Answers If you wish to delete either the question or answer under the intent, you can do so by clicking the circle with i icon and selecting Remove . \u26a0\ufe0f Once they are removed, there is no way to roll back the removal, so be careful. Deleting all data You can delete all data by selecting the gear icon at the top and selecting: Delete all data Delete all analytics Delete all unEdited Answers These are a useful feature if you wish to simply reset all of these data and start from the scratch. Intent operations When you select an intent, a popup will be displayed which shows you the operations that you can do with the selected intent. Edit category - will let you edit the current category Download to CSV - will export this into a CSV file. It will have the following format: ID,question,score,kbCoverage,answer,category,intent,pii Generate Conversation - This will convert the intent into conversation, instead of a simple question and answer. This will give a better context for the NeuralSeek to generate answers from. Flag - Will flag the intent so that you can quickly find it later. Rename - Will let you rename its name Delete - Deletes the selected intent(s). Backup - Backs up the intent for later recovery. Note that the backed up file is not a text file, but in binary format. Merge - appears only when two or more intents are selected. It merges all of their questions and answers into a single intent. There is no option to rollback the merge, so do it with caution. Dynamic Personalization What is it? One way NeuralSeek quickly ties into the users business is by automatically personalizing results based on information from their Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. By analyzing user data such as past interactions, preferences, purchase history, and demographic information, NeuralSeek can dynamically adjust its outputs to match the specific needs and preferences of each individual user. Why is it important? Personalized answers tend to engage users more, and can result in higher satisfaction and containment. How does it work? This can be previewed in the \u201cSeek\u201d tab of the NeuralSeek UI, and in production environments users will pass the personalization details via our API as the REST call to when /seek is made. Entity Extraction What is it? NeuralSeek has a feature called \u2018Extract\u2019 which is a service to let users extract entities within a given user text. Users can also define their custom entities and provide descriptions for NeuralSeek to detect and extract entities that are defined by users. The service is provided with a REST endpoint which can be used by external applications such as virtual agents or chat bots to invoke it within their conversational flow to enhance their capabilities to detect entities within it. Why is it important? Virtual Agents can define various \u2018entities\u2019, which may have values that need to be categorized into concepts or types that can play various roles during their request handling. For example, when a user types a question like: \u201cI would like to buy a movie ticket.\u201d The term \u201cmovie ticket\u201d could be categorized as \u201cproduct\u201d that the virtual agent might need to understand so that the agent could start a dialog that would continue like: \u201cSure, what kind of movie ticket do you want to purchase?\u201d Knowing that the user is interested in buying (intent) a movie ticket (product), the agent should perform an action of providing a list of the movies, as well as letting the user choose the date and time, and ultimately proceeding with billing and payment. The inherent challenge in configuring virtual agents is to make sure these entities are accurately identified by providing various patterns, values, or an entity type, so that when those words appear in the conversation, such entities can be identified. An example of that is how IBM Watson Assistant in dialog mode can define entity and its related values as such: In the above example, the entity \u2018product\u2019 would be identified in the dialog if the user mentioned these words such as \u2018movie reservation,\u2019 \u2018movie ticket,\u2019 or simply \u2018ticket.\u2019 Watson Assistant also provides fuzzy matching to match any incorrect spellings or slight deviation from these words to help it better cope with the request. However, there are obviously clear limitations and caveats in doing this approach. You have to provide every possible value necessary for the bot to understand it as a certain type of entity. Anything out of the given value might not be categorized at all, or even categorized incorrectly. Maintaining a large set of entities and its subsequent values can be costly and time consuming. If you have to support multiple languages, you may need to provide all the possible values as legal vocabularies which can then be a pretty challenging feat. How does it work? NeuralSeek\u2019s Entity Extraction uses natural language processing to extract key entities that your virtual agent needs to understand, without requiring you to specify possible values or patterns and having the burden of constantly maintaining it. Entity Extraction From Conversation Let\u2019s take a look at the above example of defining a movie ticket as a product. In the tab \u2018Extract,\u2019 enter the same text of \u2018I would like to buy a movie ticket\u2019 and click the \u2018Extract\u2019 button. You will see NeuralSeek, without specifying anything, was able to identify the movie ticket as an entity of product and properly extracted it from the given string. Moreover, you can ask the phrase in different languages, and NeuralSeek\u2019s entity extraction will still work, without you doing anything! Custom Entities In case there is a specific way that you need to categorize an entity, NeuralSeek provides a simpler and better way to define what your entity is, by using Custom Entity definition. Using this, Neural Seek can perform entity extraction in much more robust way: And obviously, this single customer entity definition would work in other languages too! Entity Extraction REST API NeuralSeek\u2019s entity extraction supports integration via REST API, so it makes calling the service easy with any external applications such as virtual agents or chatbots. It is easy to test its functionality by using API documentation located under the Integrate tab.

Why is it important? Personalized answers tend to engage users more, and can result in higher satisfaction and containment. How does it work? This can be previewed in the \u201cSeek\u201d tab of the NeuralSeek UI, and in production environments users will pass the personalization details via our API as the REST call to when /seek is made.","title":"Dynamic Personalization"},{"location":"main_features/conversational_capabilities/conversational_capabilities/#entity-extraction","text":"What is it? NeuralSeek has a feature called \u2018Extract\u2019 which is a service to let users extract entities within a given user text. Users can also define their custom entities and provide descriptions for NeuralSeek to detect and extract entities that are defined by users. The service is provided with a REST endpoint which can be used by external applications such as virtual agents or chat bots to invoke it within their conversational flow to enhance their capabilities to detect entities within it. Why is it important? Virtual Agents can define various \u2018entities\u2019, which may have values that need to be categorized into concepts or types that can play various roles during their request handling. For example, when a user types a question like: \u201cI would like to buy a movie ticket.\u201d The term \u201cmovie ticket\u201d could be categorized as \u201cproduct\u201d that the virtual agent might need to understand so that the agent could start a dialog that would continue like: \u201cSure, what kind of movie ticket do you want to purchase?\u201d Knowing that the user is interested in buying (intent) a movie ticket (product), the agent should perform an action of providing a list of the movies, as well as letting the user choose the date and time, and ultimately proceeding with billing and payment. The inherent challenge in configuring virtual agents is to make sure these entities are accurately identified by providing various patterns, values, or an entity type, so that when those words appear in the conversation, such entities can be identified. An example of that is how IBM Watson Assistant in dialog mode can define entity and its related values as such: In the above example, the entity \u2018product\u2019 would be identified in the dialog if the user mentioned these words such as \u2018movie reservation,\u2019 \u2018movie ticket,\u2019 or simply \u2018ticket.\u2019 Watson Assistant also provides fuzzy matching to match any incorrect spellings or slight deviation from these words to help it better cope with the request. However, there are obviously clear limitations and caveats in doing this approach. You have to provide every possible value necessary for the bot to understand it as a certain type of entity. Anything out of the given value might not be categorized at all, or even categorized incorrectly. Maintaining a large set of entities and its subsequent values can be costly and time consuming. If you have to support multiple languages, you may need to provide all the possible values as legal vocabularies which can then be a pretty challenging feat. How does it work? NeuralSeek\u2019s Entity Extraction uses natural language processing to extract key entities that your virtual agent needs to understand, without requiring you to specify possible values or patterns and having the burden of constantly maintaining it.","title":"Entity Extraction"},{"location":"main_features/conversational_capabilities/conversational_capabilities/#entity-extraction-from-conversation","text":"Let\u2019s take a look at the above example of defining a movie ticket as a product. In the tab \u2018Extract,\u2019 enter the same text of \u2018I would like to buy a movie ticket\u2019 and click the \u2018Extract\u2019 button. You will see NeuralSeek, without specifying anything, was able to identify the movie ticket as an entity of product and properly extracted it from the given string. Moreover, you can ask the phrase in different languages, and NeuralSeek\u2019s entity extraction will still work, without you doing anything!","title":"Entity Extraction From Conversation"},{"location":"main_features/conversational_capabilities/conversational_capabilities/#custom-entities","text":"In case there is a specific way that you need to categorize an entity, NeuralSeek provides a simpler and better way to define what your entity is, by using Custom Entity definition.

When using webpages as documentation for the KnowledgeBase, nuisance information such as banners and cookies will deteriorate information relevant to the users organization. The Automatic Data Cleansing feature of NeuralSeek will automatically cleanse the web pages that were scraped, exposing information pertinent to the organization, at the users own pace. Why is it important? Condensing and focusing the information, while removing useless wording returned by the KnowledgeBase is critical to high quality answer generation. Most web content is not great at directly answering questions because of the amount of nuisance webpage language that gets extracted with the core content. How does it work? NeuralSeek will identify documents in the KnowledgeBase that come from webscrapes. NeuralSeek will then run its own algorithm against the full webpage HTML to extract just the core content and remove as much of the extraneous information as possible. Caching What is it? NeuralSeek uses caching strategy in two areas (Corporate KnowledgeBase and Answer) to enhance performance and reduce computational cost during its operation. Why is it important? Caching frequently returned answers saves both time and computation cost to run virtual agents, as it reduces NeuralSeek having to generate responses repeatedly, especially on the more frequently asked questions or seldom updated answers. How does it work? The first part is when NeuralSeek searches through the corporate knowledge base to obtain the original information. You can set the cache duration of such responses to be cached, so that the original information\u2019s retrieval time can be reduced. NeuralSeek then utilizes two types of caches for both your edited answers and generated answers that can serve cached answers to user questions in order to speed up response times and produce more consistent results. Corporate KnowledgeBase Cache When NeuralSeek accesses the Corporate KnowledgeBase, it processes the original data from it, cleanses its contents (e.g. removing unnecessary contents, filtering, deduplicating, etc.), compresses it, and prioritize the returned contents which is then processed with LLM (Large Language Model) to form the completed response, usually at the range of 8,000 ~ 9,000 characters. It then derives a hash value of that response window which acts as a check to later see if the original data is updated. This response is what actually gets cached within the NeuralSeek, so that all those search, processing, and LLM-generated time is effectively saved when the same answer needs to be derived. Under the Configure > Corporate KnowledgeBase Details section, user can set the duration of the cache measured in minutes to control how long these responses need to be cached. Answer Cache When the user asks a question to NeuralSeek, it tries to use the question to find the matching \u2018intent\u2019 of the question. And when the matching intent is discovered (usually via a fuzzy matching), the provided answer, either normal or user edited, can then be cached. Under the Configure > Intent Matching & Cache Configuration section, you can enable or disable the edited answer cache or normal answer cache, and set the following parameters to control how it works: Each cache type (edited answer, normal) would have the answer threshold bar and edited answer match tolerance. You can adjust the threshold to control when the caching will start caching for the answer, depending on how many answers exist for a given user question. For example, if you set the threshold to 5, the caching will not start until there exist 5 or more different answers to the given question. Setting the threshold to 1 would let NeuralSeek start caching as soon as it sees at least a single answer exists. Setting the value to 0 will disable caching completely. The matching method (Exact Match, Fuzzy Match, etc.) is the method you can specify to tell NeuralSeek on how to perform the intent matching on the question. There is also a more advanced matching method of \u2018Exact Match, exact conversational context\u2019 on the normal answers that would try to find the match if the consecutive conversation (e.g. one and the one after) both have the matching result, so that the match could be more correct in terms of how the conversation flow is occurring. In terms of the edited answers, this \u2018conversational context\u2019 matching is not provided given that the edited answers should be more concise and based on a more substantial ground and thus should not rely on the conversational context. Detecting changes in the original source In order to make sure the cached answers retain the authenticity, every cached answers are fed into an hashing algorithm to generate a unique hash key, which is then compared with the original source to detect whether the original source has been altered or not. If the hash keys do not match, NeuralSeek will notify users that the answers are not up-to-date with what\u2019s found in the KnowledgeBase. This would happen when a particular answer is being used during the Seek time, so that the answer would be kept in check with the original. Users can then take a look at the outdated answer, and can either delete and reload it, or edit it and then mark it as current, so that NeuralSeek will be able to check it off from its outdated list. One other way the answer would be checked is when NeuralSeek is handling round trip logging. During that time, NeuralSeek would check which answers are getting frequently returned and also perform asynchronous checks with the KnowledgeBase to make sure they are up-to-date. How do we know the answers are coming from cache? You can check whether your query matched and returned the cached answer in the Seek tab. For example, this is an example of the answer returned from the cache. Next to the Total Response Time , you will see a label Cached which indicates that the answer came straight from the cache. Content Analytics What is it? NeuralSeek incorporates content analytics as a built-in feature, eliminating the need for additional code. With Content Analytics in NeuralSeek, users can effortlessly gather information about what users are searching for, assess the extent of documentation available on those topics, and evaluate documentation efficiency in addressing user queries. Why is it important? Content Analytics are a powerful feature that enable insight on the performance of your corporate documentation. You can gain insights on where content is excellent, underperforming, nonexistent or seldom used - and inform the groups responsible for creating or updating that information on how better to allocate their time. How does it work? Two main scores are returned when a user asks a question to NeuralSeek: Coverage Score: This score represents the number of documents or sections of documents that discuss the subject area(s) of a question from NeuralSeek. Confidence Score: The confidence score represents the likelihood that the information found in the KnowledgeBase of NeuralSeek and presented as a response is correct. This probability is given as a percentage. Low scoring questions with low coverage scores tend to mean there is little or no documentation on the subject. Low scoring questions with high coverage tends to mean there are conflicting source documents.","title":"Data Management"},{"location":"main_features/data_management/data_management/#automatic-data-cleansing-and-preparation","text":"What is it?

NeuralSeek provides a service that would analyze and identify the language of a given text. Why is it important? Any application that would need to understand which language a given text is can now use NeuralSeek to do it, rather than relying on other external services. How does it work? Language identification is provided as REST API, and can be tested on NeuralSeek API documentation . Message payload is in text/plain format, and contains text in certain languages. An example message would look something like this: \uc774 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub294 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc785\ub2c8\uae4c? NeuralSeek would then identify what language this is in, and returns the language code and the confidence score: [ { \"language\" : \"ko\" , \"confidence\" : 0.95 } ] Intent Categorization What is it? NeuralSeek can automatically categorize user input and questions into categories. These categories can be anything - products, organizations, departments, etc. Users can set up categories on the Configure Tab, by entering category names and descriptions. These will then be used to match user input into categories. User inputs that do not match any category, or that too closely matche multiple categories will be placed in a default category called \"Other\". This default category cannot be modified.

Categorization can be useful even outside the context of answering user questions - for example, in routing customer questions to the correct department or live agent. Categorization can be called directly via the API. How does it work? User input is scored and bucketed based on the category title and description, and based on intents that have been manually moved into categories (self-learning). Once categorization is enabled, the Curate and Analytics screens will change to show groupings around categories. Categorization is not retroactive - meaning if you define a new category, we will not automatically re-run all old user input against the new categories. Users may move intents into categories manually through the Curate tab or the CSV download/edit features. The edits made will be used to train the system for future categorization events. Language Translation What is it? NeuralSeek provides language translation that will let users call it to translate languages into different languages. Why is it important?

These can be adjusted on the \u201cConfigure\u201d section of the NeuralSeek console, or on the \u201cSeek\u201d endpoint. Please see the below table for the full list of supported languages. Why is it important? Being able to automatically translate answers to an appropriate language without relying on a virtual agent is important, as this greatly simplifies running it. Instead of having to train your virtual agents to understand various different languages, your question can be automatically converted into the response in the language of your choice. How does it work? NeuralSeek will try to determine if the user is asking a question in a certain language (e.g. Spanish), and will try to convert the responses into the language that the user asked without any additional set ups.

This feature empowers users to analyze and track user interactions with the \"Seek\" feature, offering valuable insights into system performance. The efficient filtering options enhance the usability of the log, providing a streamlined experience. This functionality is important for troubleshooting, understanding user behavior, and making informed decisions to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the \"Seek\" feature within NeuralSeek. How does it work? Users are able to view the history of questions and answers, search for specifics using the magnifying glass icon, or filter by date, session ID, question, and answer using the arrows provided.","title":"Logs"},{"location":"reference_material/configuration/","text":"Configure Feature This location of NeuralSeek is where users can edit the configurations for NeuralSeek\u2019s features. There are two types of configurations: Default Configurations and Advanced Configurations. Default Configurations KnowledgeBase Connection: Users can change their KnowledgeBase type along with the associated url, API keys, project ID, and other relevant information. Use the drop down arrows to manually configure the fields of the schema in the connected KnowledgeBase. Curation data field: select where your FAQ content/document body is located. Document name field: select what is displayed for the title. Link field: select the URL below the title, or what will be served in the Virtual Agent chat bubble as a link. Filter field: select the field you want to filter by. For example, you can filter for a specfic document type in your KnowledgeBase and only return PDF's. Users have the option to enable or diasble attributing sources inside LLM context by document name. For example, when disabled the output will be formatted with only the document contents. When enabled, the output will be formatted with an introductory sentance that attritubes the 'document content' to the appropriate document 'name' (e.g. \"The document 'name' states that: 'document content'). Users are able to enter a prioritized list of values that you want to re-rank above other results, regardless of KB score. This can be modified under the Re-Sort values list menu. See our supported KnowledgeBase page for more information on supported KnowledgeBases. LLM Details: This is where users can add a LLM of choice, and set or modify their LLM model settings. By clicking \"Add an LLM\", users will be prompted to select an LLM from their platform of choice and enter the relevant information such as API keys, endpoint URLs, project ID's, etc. Use the drop down arrow to enable languages of choice: there are a total of 56 supported LLM languages. Users can also modify which NeuralSeek functions to enable for the added LLM. Note that you must add at least one LLM. If you add multiple, NeuralSeek will load-balance across them for the selected functions that have multiple LLM's. Features that an LLM are not capable of will be unselectable. If you do not provide an LLM for a function, there is no fallback and that function of NeuralSeek will be disabled. This section is only available if you are using BYOLLM (bring your own LLM) plan of NeuralSeek . Company/Organization Preferences: This is where you can enter your company name, and description of what the company primarily focuses on. Note that the description is also used as a stump speech which is a block of text to be used to help generate a response when all else fails, and the answer needs to fall back to it. Users can also select whether to add or not add Company Response Affinity which adds affinity to the company on top of any affinity that may be already present in your KnowledgeBase and Stump Speeches. Platform Preferences: This is where you can set up your primary default language (e.g. English), whether the response would contain the embedded link into returned responses, a list of custom stopwords if you want to override the NeuralSeek default stopwords, and also a virtual agent type that NeuralSeek can generate its questions and answers to. See our supported Virtual Agent platforms page . Intent Categorization: This is where you can create type of categories and their descriptions to control how some of the intents in user question can be categorized into. Usually a question would be automatically categorized as FAQ , but you can provide additional ones here. Governance & Guardrails: Users are able to adjust the following: Attribute Checking: Adjust misinformation tolerance for generating text about the company, or associating people or things that lack specific references in the KnowledgeBase material by using the sliding scale from \"Rigid\" to \"Standard\". The more rigid your setting, the higher the chances of occasionally blocking legitimate questions that use alternate wording or are poorly documented in your KnowledgeBase. Semantic Score: The Semantic Score model checks the generated answer against the KnowledgeBase sources, and rates the answer based on the quantity and focus of the KnowledgeBase and Stump Speech source documentation (e.g. is the answer primarily formed from a single source or many?) Toggle the icons to enable or disable the Semantic Score Model, using Semantic Score as the basis for Warning & Minimum confidence (e.g. Do NOT Enable for usecases requiring language translation), reranking the search results based on the Semantic Match, and checking the document titles and URL's as part of the Semantic Match. Note that semantic scoring will not be accurate when getting answers in a diferent language than your KnowledgeBase source docs. Semantic Model Tuning: use the sliding scales to further tune the Semantic Match. Missing key search term penalty: After scoring, this penalty is applied for answers that are missing KnowledgeBase attribution of proper nouns that were included in the search. Missing search term penalty: After scoring, this penalty is applied for answers that are missing KnowledgeBase attribution of other nouns that were included in the search. Source Jump penalty: When anwers join across many source documents it can be an indication of lost meaning or intent, depending on your source documentation. Total Coverage weight: Looking at the answer, how much weight should be given to the total coverage alone, regardless of other penalty. Increasing this helps prevent abnormally low scores from long, highly-stitched answers. Decreasing will better catch hallucination in short answers. ReRanK Min Coverage %: What is the minimum coverage of the total answer that the top used source document needs to be reranked over the top KB-scored document. Profanity Filter: Users are able to toggle the icon to enable or disable the profanity filter, as well as add a text to reply with for sensitive questions that are blocked. (e.g. \"That seems like a sensitive question. Maybe I'm not understanding you, so try rephrasing.\"). Warning Confidence: Use the sliding scale to increase the confidence percentage for warning. Add a text to prepend a warning on low confidence results. (e.g. \"I'm not an expert in this, but...\"). Minimum Confidence: Use the sliding scale to increase the minimum confidence percentage and the minimum confidence percentage to display a URL. Add a text to reply with for questions not meeting the minimum confidence, and select whether to add a URL fallback on minimum. (e.g. \"There is nothing in our knowledge base about that.\"). Minimum Text: Use the sliding scale to set a desired minimum amount of words in a question. Add a text to reply with for questions not meeting the minimum input text length. (e.g. \"Give me a bit more to go on...\"). Maximum Length: Use the sliding scale to set a desired maximum amount of words in a question. Use a low limit to help mitigate adversarial questions designed to generate inappropriate answers. Set to 100 to remove the limit. Add a text to reply with for questions over the input word limit. (e.g. \"Can you please summarize your question for me? Questions should be limited to 20 words.\"). Advanced Configurations KnowledgeBase Tuning: Tuning your Knowledgebase is an important part of creating a well performing system. Start by entering a seek query on the Seek tab to review the answer provided, as well as look at the documentation in the accordions below the answer. If the answer is not suitable for your needs, first check if the top document is correct and complete. If not, adjust snippet size by using the slider bars to improve KB training. Secondly, check if your answers are bringing back more irrelevant documentation than you need. If so, use the slider bars to set a max documents per seek or use the sliding scale to set a lower document score upper range. Further, you can adjust the document date penalty to ensure relevancy, and adjust the cache timeout in minutes but using the KnowledgeBase Query Cache (minutes) sliding scale. Prompt Engineering: Prompt Engineering allows expert users to inject specific instructions into the LLM prompt. Most use cases will not need this and should not use this. (e.g. do not enter \"provide factual information\" or \"act as a helpful customer support agent\".) NeuralSeek's extensive prompting already does this. Do not casually enable, as you can weaken the safeguards and extensive prompting that NeuralSeek provides out-of-the-box. Do not use any language other than English in prompt engineering. Answer Engineering & Preferences: Users are able to use the sliding scale to set whether the answer generation would stick to being concise, or can have more freedom to be flexible. Toggle the icon to True or False to force answers from the Knowledgebase if desired. Also, as part of answer engineering, you can provide regular expression and replacement pair so that certain pattern of data or sensitive information can be replace or removed as necessary. Answer Engineering uses Javascript Regular Expressions to selectivley replace text in both the KnowledgeBase training data and the live generated answer. (e.g. Use this to remove or swap phone numbers, emails, etc.). Intent Matching & Cache Configuration: Here is where you can configure strategies to perform intent matching. The following types of intent match's are available: Exact Match, Vector Similarity, Fuzzy Match, Keyword Match, and Fuzzy Keyword Match. Users can also configure how the answer caching is to be done for edited answers, and normal answers. You can control the number of answers that would trigger the cache, as well as their individual matching methods by using the sliding scales. Toggle the icon to Yes or No if desired to require the cache to follow context as well. Table Understanding: Table understanding pre-processes your documents to extract and parse tabular data into a format suitable for conversational query. Since this preparation process is both costly and time consuming, this feature is opt-in and will consume 1 seek query for every table preprocessed. Web Crawl Collections are not eligible for table understanding, as the re-crawl interval will cause excessive compute usage. Table preparation time takes several minutes per page. Please contact cloud@cerebralblue.com with details of your opportunity and use case to be considered for access. Note that Table Understanding requires a compatible LLM with Table Understanding Enabled. Not all LLM's are capable of Table Understanding. Personal Identifiable Information (PII) Handling: Users can define how to handle any detected PII data that was included in the question. The following options are available: Mask, Flag, No Action, Hide (retain for Analytics), and Delete (including from Analytics). The configuration also lets you add any particular examples of PII data, so it can be better detected, or set as No PII so that it can be ignored. Corporate Document Filter: Connect NeuralSeek to an external corporate rules engine to filter allowed documentation by user. Each request will send the id's of the found documentation to a endpoint you set here. Any ID's not returned back from the corporate filter will be blocked. Toggle the icon to Enable to Disable this feature. If enabled, fill out all relevant information including: Base URL for the corporate filter (get), URL paramenter for the UserName, URL paramenter for the KB field, and the Knowledgebase field to send. Corporate Logging: Connect NeuralSeek to a corporate audit logging endpoint. When connected and enabled, all requests and responses to the Seek api endpoint, as well as the Curate tab will be logged to your elasticSearch instance. Toggle the icon to Enable to Disable this feature. If enabled, fill out all relevant information including: ElasticSearch Endpoint and ElasticSearch API Key.

NeuralSeek will automatically generate IBM Watson Assistant \u201cActions\u201d or \u201cDialogs,\u201d based on user questions that are asked. Generally, IBM Watson Assistant needs five (5) or more user question examples to train on for a high confidence match to a user query. When user questions are cataloged by the system, NeuralSeek automatically tries to generate similar worded questions to meet the minimum of five (5) user examples. Similar Question generation may take up to one (1) minute to show inside the Curate tab after a new user question is logged. Why is it important? Users who develop and maintain Watson Assistant have to work with its Actions and Dialogs, and can quickly get overwhelmed by its vast numbers. Coming up with multiple number of questions for each intent is also very time consuming, but it also quickly becomes burdensome when you have to continuously monitor and update them by yourself. How does it work? NeuralSeek provides ways to generate the candiate questions and answers based on the contents inside the KnowledgeBase, and let users download the whole thing or portions of it, so that it could be created either as 1) Watson Assistant Actions, or 2) Watson Assistant Dialogs. Generating Questions and Answers After you have configured NeuralSeek, in its Home , you will see an option to auto-generate questions. Clicking will let NeuralSeek scan through your KnowledgeBase, and start generating potential questions that would be most commonly used. The resulting list of questions appear at the bottom. If you do not like the list of questions, you can re-generate them again, or edit them on the spot. When you feel like you can generate the Answers for those questions, you can click Submit button and those questions will be available on the curate tab of the top menu. Usually the most recently entered questions and answers appear at the top: Testing Questions During the curation process, usually the user would need to use Seek tab to submit questions to see how well the answer is generated. However, this process can be tedious if you have a certain set of questions that you want to ask in bulk and derive the results. In that case, you can use Upload Test Questions to upload multiple questions and generate their answers easily. Go to Home of NeuralSeek, and click Upload Test Questions . In the instructions, you will see a link of template file that you can download from. It's a template file in CSV format. click it to download. Use the file to enter the list of questions. For example, ID,Question 1,\"What are the main features of NeuralSeek?\" 2,\"What are the knowledgebases supported by NeuralSeek?\" 3,\"I want to integration NeuralSeek with Watson Assistant.

Uploading Curated Q/A This feature is very similar to Upload Test Questions , but uses the CSV format that has ID,Question,Answer . User can create question and answer pairs to submit it, which will then be populated as edited answers in NeuralSeek. This feature is useful when you need to edit and upload answers in bulk fashion. An example format of the CSV is as follows: ID,Question,Answer 1,Tell me about NeralSeek,\"NeuralSeek is an AI-powered platform that generates natural-language answers to complex, open-ended, and contextual questions from real customers.\" Importing Q/A into Watson Assistant Depending on how your NeuralSeek is setup, it can either product questions and answers into Action type or Dialog type. That depends on whether your Watson Assistant is enabled with dialog or not. Importing into Watson Assistant as Actions \ud83d\udc49 As for importing Q&A into Watson Assistant, you can do it on both Watson Assistant Classic mode or new Dialog mode. Go to your Watson Assistant, and to go to Actions . Click the gear icon on top right to go into the settings. In the global settings, move to the right most tab which is Upload/Download , and click Download button to download the action's JSON file. A JSON file should be saved. Go to NeuralSeek, click Curate tab. Click Import Base Watson Assistant Actions . Upload the downloaded JSON file. Now, select one or more intents which you want to import into Watson Assistant. You will notice a new button is display which is Export to Watson Assistant Actions . It will download a JSON file called actions.json which will contain the selected intents that you want to convert it into Watson Assistant Actions. Go to Watson Assistant. At the same page where you just downloaded the JSON, click to select a file, and select the actions.json and click Upload button. You will see a warning message. Click Upload and replace . Now, close this page, and you will see the exported actions appear on your actions list. Click one of the actions. You should be able to see the list of the quesitons generated by NeuralSeek nicely populated. With these, you can easy save time to jump start Watson Assistant to provide better answers to the questions and answers generated by NeuralSeek. One other nice thing about this is that if you find any particular questions and answers that does not yet exist in Watson Assistant, you can easily move them from NeuralSeek. Importing into Watson Assistant as Dialogs Unlike importing them as Actions, you first need to export your Watson Assistant's dialogs and set them as Base Watson Assistant Dialog into NeuralSeek. That is because Watson Assistant, when uploading a Dialog, would simply override the existing dialog and upload a new one. In order to make sure any existing actions or dialogs are not deleted, NeuralSeek needs to have it first, and then merge the dialogs into it. Go to your Watson Assistant, and to go Dialog > Options > Upload / Download : Click Download tab and click Doanload button: A JSON file should be downloaded. Now go to NeuralSeek, and go to Curate tab. Click Import Base Watson Assistant Dialog button. Select the downloaded JSON file. The button will now be turned to Base Watson Assistant Dialog Uploaded . \u26a0\ufe0f Whenever there is a change of your Watson Assistant Dialog, make sure to delete the older one and upload the recent one in order to not risk losing your most up-to-date dialogs. Now, select the list of questions that you want to load it into. As soon as you select them, a new button Export to Watson Assistant Dialog will appear. You can obviously select all the questions by checking the all box at top left. Click the button to export these dialogs. Now, a JSON file should be downloaded. Load the file back into Watson Assistant using its upload tab. Note that uploading this JSON will overwrite any existing dialog contents. Click Upload and replace . If everything goes well, it will say the skills were uploaded successfully. You now have the curated answer from NeuralSeek populated as a Dialog node in Watson Assistant. Next time when the user asks the same question, Watson Assistant should be able to answer it the same way as NeuralSeek did. This is a great way to effectively manage some of the most frequent questions and answers that you uncover from NeuralSeek to be able to be transferred into the Virtual Agent's dialog, such that it will be able to be trained with better set of answers.","title":"Training Virtual Agents"},{"location":"reference_material/training_virtual_agents/#overview","text":"What is it? NeuralSeek will automatically generate IBM Watson Assistant \u201cActions\u201d or \u201cDialogs,\u201d based on user questions that are asked. Generally, IBM Watson Assistant needs five (5) or more user question examples to train on for a high confidence match to a user query. When user questions are cataloged by the system, NeuralSeek automatically tries to generate similar worded questions to meet the minimum of five (5) user examples. Similar Question generation may take up to one (1) minute to show inside the Curate tab after a new user question is logged. Why is it important? Users who develop and maintain Watson Assistant have to work with its Actions and Dialogs, and can quickly get overwhelmed by its vast numbers. Coming up with multiple number of questions for each intent is also very time consuming, but it also quickly becomes burdensome when you have to continuously monitor and update them by yourself. How does it work? NeuralSeek provides ways to generate the candiate questions and answers based on the contents inside the KnowledgeBase, and let users download the whole thing or portions of it, so that it could be created either as 1) Watson Assistant Actions, or 2) Watson Assistant Dialogs.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"reference_material/training_virtual_agents/#generating-questions-and-answers","text":"After you have configured NeuralSeek, in its Home , you will see an option to auto-generate questions.

Often times, this is faster than a custom Python script. It simplifies many tasks - API connections, data formatting, mathematics - streamlining the process of preparing data for further language model processing. How does it work? Users utilize template commands within NTL to query databases, websites, uploaded documents, APIs, and more, while specifying parameters for extraction and formatting. The resulting data is then available for use in driving subsequent language generation. Some general rules Considering the extensive use of double quotes in NTL, typically you will need to \\\"\\\" escape double quotes to use in functions. For example, in SQL / Database queries. Any blank value (e.g. \"\") is considered \"not present\" or null-equivalent. Variables used with << >> notation will always expand in-place. All Explore NTL/Functions Get Data Text This is plain, minimally processed text that gets sent to the next step - usually either directly to the base LLM, or sent through a chain. KB Documentation KB stands for KnowledgeBase, and the query is used to retrieve snippets of document from the configured KnowledgeBase. {{ kb|query:\"your KB query\" | snippet: \"\" | scoreRange: \"\" | filter: \"\" }} Parameters: Query: The KB query. Best results are achieved by removing stopwords from this text, or using keywords. Snippet: Snippet size (character count): 10 - 2000. Score range: Upper bound of document scores to return: 0.0 - 1.0. For example, a score range of \"0.8\" will return the highest 80% scoring documents, discarding the lowest/20% of scored documents. Filter: If there is a filter field set for the connected KnowledgeBase (in the Configure Tab), set the value to filter/match. Returns: Documentation snippets from configured KnowledgeBase data source. Seek Perform a seek action, as if entering a question on the seek tab. {{ seek|query:\"your Seek query\" | stump: \"\" | filter: \"\" | language: \"\" | seekLLM: \"\" }} Parameters: Query: The question/query. Stump: Optional stump data/documentation that overrides existing stump. Use this to add relevant data/documentation to help seek answer your question. Filter: If there is a filter field set for the connected KnowledgeBase (in the Configure Tab), set the value to filter/match. Language: Target language for the generated answer. Seek LLM: Explicitly set the LLM to use for this query. Available on BYOLLM (Bring your own LLM) plans. Returns: A natural language generated answer to query . Extract Extract entities from text. Configure entities in the Extract Tab. {{ extract }} Returns: JSON representation of the extracted entities. Example: Input: My phone number is 555-555-5555=>{{ extract }} Output: (You may see more entities than shown below - this is only an example) { \"phone-number\" : [ \"555-555-5555\" ] } Explore {{ explore|template: \"templateName\" }} Imports the contents of templateName into the current environment. Example 1: Given an example template, neuralseek_updates : Based on the changelogs found here: {{ web|url:\"https://documentation.neuralseek.com/changelog/\" }} list the items for the latest month. {{ LLM }} Simply using {{ explore|template: \"neuralseek_updates\" }} will produce the sample result. Example 2: To pass parameters to Explore templates, you simply define the variables in your current environment. Given an example template, neuralseek_updates : Based on the changelogs found here: {{ web|url:\"<< name:'url' >>\" }} list the items for the latest month. {{ LLM }} To pass the url variable to the template: {{ variable | name: \"url\" | value: \"https://documentation.neuralseek.com/changelog/\" }} {{ explore|template: \"neuralseek_updates\" }} This allows templates to be brought into current context, effectively \"splicing\" the contents into the desired context. REST Connect to any REST API. {{ post|url: \"\" | headers: \"\" | body: \"\" | operation: \"POST\" | jsonToVars: \"true\" }} Parameters: URL: The API connection target. Headers: JSON headers of the request. Body: The body of the request. Operation: The type of connection request: POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH JSON to Vars: Parse the API/JSON response into Explore-usable environment variables: true, false Returns: If jsonToVars is false, the JSON response from the API request. If jsonToVars is true, returns blank/empty as the return response is imported into the environment as variables. Website Text Scrapes the URL given for any available plain text. {{ web|url:\"https://yourpage.com/\" }} Parameters: URL: The API connection target. Returns: The plain text contents of URL. Example: {{ web|url:\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman\" }}=>{{ keywords|nouns:false }} This will extract proper nouns from the Wikipedia page for Roman . The result will be similar to: Wikipedia, encyclopedia, Roman, Romans, rom\u00e2n, Wiktionary, Rome, Italy Ancient Rome, BC, Rome Epistle, Testament, Christian Bible Roman, Music Romans, Sound Horizon, EP, Teen, Boy, Morning Musume Film, Film Roman, Indian Malayalam, Doctor, People Roman, Romans \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9, Rhomaioi, Greeks, Middle Ages, Ottoman, R\u00fbm, Muslim, Bulgaria Roman Municipality Roman, Eure, France Roman, Romania Roman County, Sakha Republic, Russia Roman River, Essex, England Roman Valley, Nova Scotia, Canada Romans Romans, Ain, France Romans, Deux, S\u00e8vres, France Romans dIsonzo, Italy Romans, sur-Is\u00e8re, France Religion Roman Catholic, Roman Catholic, Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, Roman Space Telescope, NASA, ROMAN, Search, Wikipedia., Romans History, Greco, Romany, Gypsies, Roma, Disambiguation, Wikidata Upload Document Uploading a document works in two steps. When you click the Upload Document button, you are presented with a file selector to select a local document for upload. Some supported files are .docx, .doc, .pdf, .txt, .csv, .json, and .xlsx. After the document is successfully uploaded, it is available in the NTL templates: The uploaded document can then be used with the following syntax: {{ doc|name:title_application_receipt.pdf }} Parameters: Name: The name of the uploaded document. Returns: The plain text of the document. Currently, the document processing does not support OCR. Generate Data Send to LLM Send to LLM may be the most frequently used function in NTL. This function sends all previous post-chain content to the LLM for processing. {{ LLM | prompt: \"\" }} Parameters: Prompt: An additional prompt to prepend to the previous/existing content in the environment. Returns: The textual generated output/response of the LLM. Example: Write a short poem about NeuralSeek Here is the definition of NeuralSeek: {{ web|url:\"https://documentation.neuralseek.com/\" }}=>{{ summarize|length:200 }} {{ LLM }} This will write a short poem about NeuralSeek, based on the content retrieved from our documentation. In the LLM syntax, you can add additional prompts such as: Write a short poem about NeuralSeek Here is the definition of NeuralSeek: {{ web|url:\"https://documentation.neuralseek.com/\" }}=>{{ summarize|length:200 }} {{ LLM|prompt: \"write in Spanish\" }} This will prepend \"write in Spanish\" to the whole prompt given to the LLM, outputting a poem in Spanish. Table Understanding This function allows for natural language Q/A against csv/xlsx files. You start by uploading a spreadsheet, either an Excel or CSV file. Then, you are able to generate insightful responses about the source data by providing queries in natural language. NeuralSeek undertakes a comprehensive examination of the provided data to output an accurate response. At the bottom of the screen, NeuralSeek provides a confidence percentage, accompanied by a statement of confidence, for example: \"Table Understanding reports a confidence level of %\". This percentage is based on how much the system trusts the answer it gave you based on what it found in the data. {{ TableUnderstanding|query:\"What year had the highest revenue?\" }} Parameters: Query: The natural language query to ask of the given csv/xlsx. Returns: The expected value from the table to answer the Query. Example: Mathematical Equation {{ math|equation:\"1 + 1\" }} Performs mathematical equation on input strings.

Returns: If Sentences is set to true, returns results in natural language description similar to TablePrep. If Sentences is set to false, returns the query response in tabular format. Control Flow Set Variable Creates or sets a variable that can be used later in the NTL expression. For example, 34=>{{ variable | name:\"age\" }} or {{ variable | name: \"age\" | value: \"34\" }} Parameters: Name: The name of the variable to set. Value: The optional (override) value to set to the variable. No Returns. Use Variable Syntax to use / expand a variable into the environment. << name: variableName, prompt: true >> Parameters: Name: The name of the variable Prompt: If set to true, the UI will prompt for the value for this variable. If set to false, the UI will avoid prompting for this variable. Returns: The contents of the variable. Note about variables When the variable is NOT found but used in << >> notation, the variable is considered as user input, and explore will prompt for the value prior to evaluation. For example, if you have << name: new >> or << name: new, prompt: true >> and there is not such thing as {{ variable|name: \"new\" }} in the expression, explore will ask for it like this: Condition The Conditional function allows us to direct the flow of operations. {{ condition | value: \"1 == 1\" }} Parameters: Value: The conditional / logic to evaluate. Supports the following: Common comparison operators like == , != , > , < , >= , <= , <> . Basic math operators like * , ^ , / , - , + . Basic functions: IF(), NOT(), AND(,,,), OR(,,,) String comparisons: Using single-quoted strings, you can compare Returns: No returns, however: A condition that evaluates to 'true' will continue the horizontal chain. A condition that evaluates to 'false' will stop the horizontal chain from executing and continue to the next flow step. Example 1: {{ condition | value: \"1 == 1\" }}=>This is true! Will yield the output text: This is true! Example 2: {{ condition | value: \"OR(1==1,2==3)\" }}=>This is true! Will continue the chain and yield the output text: This is true! , where: {{ condition | value: \"OR(1==2,2==3)\" }}=>This is true! Will stop the chain and yield no output, as the chain was blocked with a false condition. Example 3: {{ condition | value: \"'name' == 'name'\" }}=>This is true! Will yield the output text: This is true!

Example 1: I have 20 cats and 40 dogs. {{ split | start: \"20\" | end: \"40\" | removeHeaders: false }} will yield: 20 cats and Example 2: Using removeHeaders will strip frequently repeating lines out of given input text: My animals: I have 20 cats and 40 dogs. My animals: I have 47 hamsters and 22 pet snakes. My animals: I pet all my animals every day. {{ split | removeHeaders: true }} Would yield: I have 20 cats and 40 dogs. I have 47 hamsters and 22 pet snakes. I pet all my animals every day. Regular Expression Performs regular expression on input data. Regular expression can be a powerful feature to extract or replace certain data. {{ regex | match: \"\" | replace: \"\" | group: \"\" }} Parameters: Match: The match regex to use. E.g. /[^0-9A-Za-z\\s]/g Replace: The string to substitute for matches. Group: Returns: The replaced text, or in case of using the group parameter, the group match. Example 1: If you have a text that you need to replace with something else, you can use the following expression: my name is howardyoo {{ regex | match: \"yoo\" | replace: \"yu\" }} Which yields: my name is howardyu Example 2: Regex also supports extraction. For example, if you want to extract the email address in a text message, you can do so: my name is howardyoo@email.com {{ regex | match: \"[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}\" | group: \"0\" }} This will extract the email address (group 0). The result is: howardyoo@email.com Example 3: Regex also supports groups, so in case you want to get the last digits of a phone number, you can do so: my phone number is 213-292-3322 {{ regex | match: \"([0-9]+)-([0-9]+)-([0-9]+)\" | group: \"3\" }} which will result in: 3322 Send Data REST See REST under \"Get Data\". This is the same function. Email SMTP Server connection. Easily send emails.

Often times, this is faster than a custom Python script. It simplifies many tasks - API connections, data formatting, mathematics - streamlining the process of preparing data for further language model processing. How does it work? Users utilize template commands within NTL to query databases, websites, uploaded documents, APIs, and more, while specifying parameters for extraction and formatting. The resulting data is then available for use in driving subsequent language generation. Some general rules Considering the extensive use of double quotes in NTL, typically you will need to \\\"\\\" escape double quotes to use in functions. For example, in SQL / Database queries.
