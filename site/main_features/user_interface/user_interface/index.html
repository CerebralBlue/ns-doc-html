<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The home page is where users can get started interacting with NeuralSeek and quickly set up a chatbot in a matter of moments (see NeuralSeek onboarding).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is it important?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The home page of NeuralSeek is a crucial feature for swift chatbot deployment. Users can efficiently set up their virtual agents by providing organization details, connecting to their KnowledgeBase, and selecting a preferred Large Language Model. The option to configure organization details, tune documentation parameters, and auto-generate actions streamlines the process. Additionally, NeuralSeek addresses a common challenge by offering automated question generation based on the KnowledgeBase content, saving time and improving interaction quality. The ability to input, categorize, and review questions, along with uploading test questions for analytics, makes it an indispensable tool for users aiming to create effective and responsive virtual agents in a matter of moments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basics</strong>: User provides general information about their organization with NeuralSeek.</li>
<li><strong>Data</strong>: Where users connect to their KnowledgeBase (can also be done under the “Configure” tab).</li>
<li><strong>LLM</strong>: (only available with Bring Your Own LLM plan) Users can select their preferred LLM (Large Language Model) of choice. Users are required to enter the appropriate integration information (e.g. API key of their LLM) in order to continue.</li>
<li><strong>About:</strong> Describing the organization and use case preferences.</li>
<li><strong>Tune:</strong> Provide information about the documentation/KnowledgeBase.</li>
<li><strong>Q&amp;A:</strong> Auto-generate a list of actions to set up a virtual agent in minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>User can also perform the following actions through the home page:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Auto-generate questions</strong>: Virtual Agents would typically require an adequate number of questions for creating meaningful intentions and dialogs. This process would typically involve having to manually create them. However, NeuralSeek can generate, based on the contents of your KnowledgeBase, a good set of commonly asked questions for you.</li>
<li><strong>Manually Input questions</strong>: If you already have a good set of questions that your user frequently asks, you can upload them into NeuralSeek and NeuralSeek could categorize and create their answers for you to later review and curate them.</li>
<li><strong>Upload Test questions</strong>: If you want to test out your set of questions, and validate whether their coverage or confidence score is good enough, or find out how their analytics look like, use this. A template CSV file is given for you to use it.</li>
</ul>
